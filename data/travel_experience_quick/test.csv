0	fairly satisfied	Waiting to board the bus. Sometimes it is  slow getting on.
1	fairly satisfied	Your drivers take great pleasure in leaving OAPs at the bus stop approximately 9.30 everyday. No consideration for weather.
2	fairly satisfied	Journey through Wood End is nearly always a nightmare because of the local yobs. Can something be done? Reroute down Hanley Road
3	fairly satisfied	More room for puschairs.
4	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Get to where I want to go quicker so I am not late.
5	fairly satisfied	The cost of tickets for under eighteen - too high (A child fare should be from under eighteen not under fifteen).
6	fairly satisfied	The journey is always dependent on traffic and how many passengers get on.  It would help if buses left on time, rather than to wait for driver and supervisor to finish their cigarette break.
7	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Clean bus, free wipes, double decker, comfortable seats.
8	very satisfied	For a twenty minute journey I can't think of anything
9	fairly satisfied	The electronic bus timetable said there was a bus due in 3 minutes but nothing came
10	fairly satisfied	The framework of the bus rattled the whole time.
11	very dissatisfied	Any 21 should be double deckers in rush morning and evening
12	fairly satisfied	Turning up on time.
13	fairly satisfied	The smell
14	fairly satisfied	as I am quite tall I would appreciate more leg room between seats.
15	fairly satisfied	Smoother stop at getting off -braking too soon for elderly people, me!
16	fairly satisfied	The bus coming on time
17	fairly satisfied	If the bus was cleaner and the behaviour of the passengers are improved.
18	very satisfied	The journey was ok.
19	very dissatisfied	Bus need to turn up on time.
20	fairly dissatisfied	Upon alighting at Penzance at the terminal, the bus move off the bay while we were descending from the stairs causing a fall down two steps and dropping items. The bus carried on to the middle of the depot before we could alight, driver in rush for crew change.
21	fairly satisfied	Add a timetable on the bus.
22	fairly satisfied	On other journeys, buses are overcrowded and drivers are rushing and braking dangerously etc.
23	fairly satisfied	Bus timetable to be more accurate.
24	fairly satisfied	The problem is this has been done on a good journey. If you'd asked me to do this on any of the other days in the week I'm filling this in you'd have got very different answers as it has been a nightmare due to overcrowding, waiting times at the stop (30 mins +) and up to five buses driving past before I could get on one... and even then as a standing passenger.
25	very satisfied	Very satisfied.
26	very satisfied	Nothing.  All very good.  Efficient service.
27	fairly satisfied	No problems with journey, but would appreciate an electronic display for arrivals at the stop. I struggle to see the bus info while it is moving so would appreciate if they would just stop at their stop even without being flagged down. Lots of overcrowding  at stops in Stockton and the bus struggles to stop at the right place.
28	fairly satisfied	Pelican Crossing to get over the road - it's getting really difficult with the amount of traffic going to and from Sutton to cross. We have already had one lady killed last year!
29	fairly satisfied	For the bus to have been nearer to time on timetable. Was meant to be there at 8:25am and arrived at 8:47am making school children late for school.
30	fairly satisfied	Bus too old and noisy. Rattling noise, shaking seats, old! If the bus was a horse it should have been shot years ago.
31	fairly satisfied	For the No 6 to turn up. After a day at work you want to get home. I feel Arriva forget that people rely on these buses and the No. 6 is well known for not being so.
32	fairly dissatisfied	The cleanliness and punctuality of the bus. Newer buses.
33	fairly satisfied	A little bit more room to put my shopping trolley. Some of the buses have a little bit more room than the one that I was on today.
34	very satisfied	Nothing at this time (this journey).
35	very dissatisfied	The bus was very late it was required that I fold my pushchair . I asked for driver to help put my pushchair in luggage area as I was holding my 9 month old he refused and said he is not allowed.
36	fairly satisfied	Some more seats for people.
37	fairly satisfied	Quality of buses on the route is very poor. Access impossible for disable people. Too infrequent. Lack of bells to ring despite sign saying "remain seated until the bus stops."
38	fairly satisfied	Whilst the journey to work is fine and rarely causes any concerns my journey home is terrible , quite often the buses are filthy.  I don't always feel safe and they are often late and completely missing.
39	fairly satisfied	Another service to make it faster.
40	fairly satisfied	Bus to have been on time.
41	fairly satisfied	Noise.  Very noisy (not passengers)
42	fairly satisfied	Buses running on time.  Bus shelter. Electronic displays showing next bus.
43	fairly satisfied	Drivers attitude on most services, just that elements of drivers who doesn't seem to care that you say hello, good morning. Thank you and they just ignore you. Gets the other driver a bad name.
44	fairly satisfied	Bus I was meant to get on didn't turn up which made this bus busy.
45	fairly satisfied	More frequent buses
46	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Not stopping for four or five minutes at bus stops.
47	fairly dissatisfied	Heating and more comfortable seats. Seats alright for short journeys no good for longer journeys.
48	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Greetings as you enter the bus and more time for the passengers to get seated
49	fairly dissatisfied	Send a double decker at 16:20! Every day it is extremely busy and crowded.   Some occasions it has been too busy to board.
50	fairly satisfied	Because the driver was speeding, it felt uncomfortable and dangerous from time to time.
51	very dissatisfied	I can no longer travel from Hough Green directly to Runcorn High Street so the N14 and Arriva 79 buses no longer take this route, I now have to change buses at Widnes Town Centre, making my journey to work much longer!
52	very satisfied	This journey was good but have had bad passengers on bus in past.
53	fairly satisfied	the bus could be a lot less rattily!
54	fairly dissatisfied	Comfier seats plus less time journey.
55	fairly satisfied	A long time waiting at the bus stop
56	fairly dissatisfied	Not cancelling the previous bus without warning
57	fairly satisfied	I don't find the seats on the Zap comfortable.  The covering is slippery and there are too few forward facing seats.  I prefer the Coastliner but had missed it.
58	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Screens between seats behind heads to stop people staring at you, coughing on you or reading your phone. Your website is hard to use.
59	fairly satisfied	Cooler bus air conditioner , more seats
60	fairly satisfied	Finally finishing the road works at Bristol Temple Meads railway station.
61	fairly satisfied	Asked driver about the buses back and he just shrugged and pointed at the timetable outside bus stop.
62	fairly satisfied	This driver was alright but most people can be a bit rude
63	very satisfied	The driver was good.
64	fairly satisfied	Less busy on the bus an the bus it was completely packed + the driver was unable to let more people on half way through journey
65	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	If the buses actually came on time.
66	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	It would have been nice if there had not been three buses on the same route that were eventually due to arrive at the stop within too minutes!
67	very dissatisfied	The 60 bus needs to be more frequent. After 3pm the bus stop outside M&S gets too crowded. Need more buses that do not pass through Small Heath! This is an everyday occurrence!
68	fairly dissatisfied	If bus come on time.
69	fairly satisfied	Heating and air con on all buses is very ineffective and often gives opposite result to what is intended.
70	fairly satisfied	Bus not turning up
71	fairly satisfied	Waiting till I was seated before driving from stop.
72	fairly satisfied	Drivers used to communicate more, e.g. good morning/afternoon/evening but its rare these days so I have stopped bothering. I can't remember if this particular driver said anything.
73	fairly satisfied	The waiting time for the bus.
74	fairly satisfied	Very rattily bus partly due to poor road maintenance but also the original design of the bodywork fixings is poor .  European buses are better.
75	very satisfied	Nothing could have been improved with this particular journey however the 415 service is very unreliable.  Buses are not often enough and I know plenty of people myself included who really rely non this service .  Buses are regularly missing and generally being the older buses because of the speed bumps in Alkrington they also regularly break down.  Therefore as things stand it is already ridiculous to have to wait for an hour if one bus is missing or broken down .  I am absolutely appalled to hear this service may be made hourly now.  So now if one bus is missing or broken down that would mean a two hour wait.
76	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Sort the 49 route out
77	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Buses on time for children to get home.  Before shoppers and workers going home.  Regular times all day.
78	fairly satisfied	Buses to run later at night.  Cut run times after peak periods to two in the hour instead of four per hour.
79	fairly satisfied	Visibility - too many windows in the front were obscured, can't see through front window, seats at front too high. Electronic display on all buses needed.
80	fairly satisfied	About the route 6.  Remove the option for drivers to unilaterally decide not to stop at a bus stop.
81	very satisfied	Our fantastic driver makes this service so good! Always allows safety for elderly people.
82	fairly satisfied	The only thing that could have been improved is the weather and amount of people on the bus.
83	fairly satisfied	Fewer roadworks. Better organisation of queue at the stop-fed up of people pushing in to board when other people have queued for twenty minutes or more.
84	fairly satisfied	This bus route is constantly late and as this is the only bus available it is frustrating considering other places are much much better serviced
85	very satisfied	The A bus route is very frequent and often not full with plenty of free seats during the day. No problems at all so a perfectly acceptable service. Thank you.
86	fairly satisfied	Need a shelter at the bus stop there used to be one but something drove into it.
87	fairly dissatisfied	More frequent buses.
88	fairly satisfied	If the bus stop had a shelter.
89	very satisfied	Never had an issue with the bus service.
90	very satisfied	Everything was very good.
91	very satisfied	I am happy with the buses that I use which are 43,19,19A,35, 56.  My worry is that you may remove any of them which has been happening to some bus services.
92	fairly dissatisfied	A bit more speedy.
93	fairly satisfied	Time to sit down
94	fairly satisfied	Number 2 bus service is very unreliable in general - buses are usually late or do not turn up, this bus was late even for a late morning journey. The drivers and condition of the buses are very good, the issue is the reliability and punctuality of the number 2 bus service generally
95	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	the bus was reasonably clean from litter but the grab rails, handles and seats were not clean and either dirty, greasy or worn
96	very satisfied	Fairly good
97	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	No number 8 bus from home, need a lift to get to bus stop! Also for fare paying, the cost is far too high, having just travelled recently at Weston Super Mare
98	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The bus being on time.
99	fairly satisfied	Please give more power to driver to tell people who take more time to show their e-tickets on their phones. Sometimes some people take more than two to three minutes to go through their phone to show their tickets. It is not fair, other passengers to wait just for them.
100	fairly dissatisfied	All your buses have appalling brakes that can jerk older passengers off their feet. The queues at 4pm to 5pm on the Promenade are exhausting - with seating for only four in the shelter.
101	fairly dissatisfied	Driver to not pull off while walking to seats. Route takes too long.
102	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More 52A's + 58s less 53 can be annoying see 3 or 4 turn up empty and still waiting for one of the above.
103	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Leather seats are not an improvement, you slide about to hold yourself tight. High level seats are not comfortable for those with non-long legs especially on a long journey. More space to cater for shopping bags
104	fairly satisfied	The floor of the bus was very wet on the journey to Woodcote. But the driver reported it.
105	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More time to get older people seated
106	fairly satisfied	Clearer price information as there are different routes, student prices, single and return and multi-ticket options to choose from. Always good to know the best deal/price based on the zones too.
107	fairly dissatisfied	Bus should have been on time as the previous one didn't turn up.
108	very dissatisfied	The driver did not talk to anyone and didn't lower the step down making the step high and hard to get on.
109	very satisfied	Nothing should be improved. Very good bus service
110	fairly dissatisfied	Make buses come more at their expected time. Don't make the bus stop to avoid congestion inside the bus. Cheaper cost of a bus for university students.
111	fairly satisfied	Better , cleaner buses, inside and out.
112	fairly dissatisfied	More bus only lanes
113	fairly satisfied	Smoother ride - better springing.  Punctuality.
114	fairly satisfied	Heating on bus being better now it is getting cold.
115	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Arrive on time.
116	fairly satisfied	Electronic display at the stop
117	fairly satisfied	Getting charging usb ports on the bus.
118	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Get drivers to acknowledge the passengers.
119	very satisfied	Very satisfied with this journey. In recent weeks we had a few journeys that were challenging e.g. going too fast out of the towns, hitting the kerbs, jolting. The driver on 17/11/18 should be recommended.
120	fairly satisfied	Mostly the 471 buses are always late and some don't even turn up at the correct time and if they are late there are usually 2 or 3 of them at once
121	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Should not allow people to stand at the point from front door to stairs as so difficult for people to get off and on the bus
122	fairly dissatisfied	Better information at the bus stop, there was a sign provided which suggested a service had been cancelled which contradicted the timetable, felt lonely and vulnerable waiting. Live electronic signs would be great - why were they terminated? Alter conducted route please too - all the ups and downs and ins and outs make me nauseous.
123	fairly satisfied	Temperature in the bus could be more warmer and seats could be more soft and comforting.
124	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	We don't have bus shelter at Sandiacre Drive.  Is it possible to have one .  Especially when it's very bad weather.  Some bus don't have enough space between the seats it is too narrow.  There is no room to put shopping bags.
125	fairly dissatisfied	1. Electronic notification that the bus was coming. Far too often the 41D 41A does not arrive and we don't know whether to walk down to York Road or not even in the bus station no one can tell us if the bus is coming or not. 2. If the bus driver seem to drive on their brakes, most journeys you feel like you have been on a switch back drive
126	fairly dissatisfied	The length of time the journey took.
127	very satisfied	Nothing really. Good bus service on this route.
128	very satisfied	No complaints.
129	fairly satisfied	Cheaper single tickets.
130	very satisfied	I am very satisfied with my journey to work.  Never on my return journey
131	fairly dissatisfied	Dogs sitting on the seat. Passengers under the influence of alcohol. Passenger feet on seats. Audio announcement needed in each bus.
132	fairly dissatisfied	The timing and punctuality of the bus.
133	fairly satisfied	The Route 51 is very unreliable bus route.  The times I have waited at the bus stop for the route 51 and the due time either keeps increasing or the due time comes and the bus has just disappeared of the indicator board.  We are encouraged to use public transport but if it is not reliable then what's the point.  Also the bus timetables are not harmonious with the train timetable which makes no sense.  They should arrive at least ten minutes before the train arrives at Chelmsford station so you have some chance of getting the train and vice versa getting off the train and getting the bus.  On numerous occasion I have got out of the station only for the bus to disappear of in the distance and the having the unknown wait whether the next bus will arrive or not.  Also I would like to add that the bus service should run at least to 23.30 making it easier to socialise in Chelmsford town centre in the evening knowing that you can get home cheaply and safely.
134	fairly satisfied	A bit more room between seats for shopping trolley.
135	fairly satisfied	Charge point to charge mobile phone.
136	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	96 buses never on time
137	fairly satisfied	In peak times additional buses should be provided.
138	fairly satisfied	More punctuality, though traffic makes this difficult.
139	fairly satisfied	Internet that works and last longer than 10 minutes
140	very satisfied	Nothing really, feel we have a good service. Long may it continue!
141	very dissatisfied	Nothing very satisfied
142	fairly satisfied	My opinion is drivers must get a lot of support, lots of challenges e.g. expired tickets shouting them by customers,  they are human
143	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	It would be helpful if the buses actually turned up and that if there was a problem and the bus due couldn't be there you would get informed.  It's a shambles, especially the 358 service , plus change over to Blue Tiger should be after 7 when people have finished work.  16 the worst.
144	fairly satisfied	To lower the ramp on the bus to the level of the kerb with no gap as their is many elderly passengers," who have a ""walker"" to help them walk and carry their shopping. I am one of them."
145	fairly satisfied	Bus to come on time
146	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	If the 9.15 bus I walked up the hill to catch had come instead of  me standing a good 3/4 hour. Then the next one not turning up. By the time arrived was packed, hot and smelly.
147	fairly satisfied	Punctuality at Terminus for my connection to Rampton Hospital
148	fairly satisfied	Drop the front down more so ramp is not so steep.
149	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Ticket buying process on the bus takes too long.
150	fairly satisfied	Warmth of the bus in winter seasons.
151	very satisfied	For a fifteen minute journey, everything was fine.
152	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Buses need to come on time as stated on timetable. Get rid of all buses as it makes a lot of noises and not on rocking good. Make university students fare cheaper,  example  ?1 per journey
153	fairly satisfied	Wifi doesn't always work. From previous experience whenever the bus breaks down there is a too long period of time to wait.
154	fairly satisfied	Attitude of drivers to getting out the ramp , some are good, some are bad.  Allowing two wheelchair users on the bus at the same time.
155	fairly satisfied	Nearer bus stop. I had about 500 yard walk.
156	fairly satisfied	Center bus should be arrive on time every time. Rather than that no issue.
157	fairly satisfied	Stop passengers smoking at bus stops.
158	fairly satisfied	Bus to be on time, which for 17A service is poor. And sometimes misses altogether at least twice a week or more
159	fairly dissatisfied	The physical and mechanical condition on the bus was very poor. 1. The bus was very old and the fittings shake ( and are noisy) 2. The seats are poor and lack upholstery. 3. The suspension on the bus is poor leading to an uncomfortable journey
160	fairly dissatisfied	Need more bus service for certain places.
161	fairly satisfied	maybe thinking about bus fares it be nice to involve people on low income/single parent of 5 t /day is very high/ single tickets fare should be adjusted to the length of the journey.
162	fairly satisfied	Drive nearer kerb and lower platform for a heavy shopping trolley, when very rarely do.
163	fairly satisfied	Nine out of ten this bus runs ten to fifteen minutes late and I know it gets taken off and not replaced.
164	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	At times, no bus (14) for 30 minutes peak time, then three or more arrive together.
165	fairly satisfied	Live bus locator, bus stop location, behaviour of other passengers, maintenance, audio announcements.
166	fairly satisfied	Cheaper fares!
167	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Another bus driver . This one is the most miserable and unhelpful bus driver that I have ever encountered. Recently, he event told passenger that he did not speak English just because they asked a simple question.
168	fairly satisfied	Nothing: yesterday I waited thirty minutes for the bus to get to Poole from Hamworthy because of Hunger Hill roadworks now.
169	fairly satisfied	Make them on time always or only reasonably late
170	fairly satisfied	More space.  Working Wi-Fi as it does not work and I take this daily route.  Rowdiness of others on the bus.  General tidiness of the bus.  The driver could have given time for the passengers to be seated before driving off at speed.
171	very satisfied	Everything under control.  Very satisfied.
172	fairly satisfied	My service X3 is currently delays through roadworks on A338 which can severely delay. Their arrival, real time information on these delays would be useful at present is non-existent.
173	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The bus size.
174	fairly satisfied	More information about the stops a) on the bus (map of the road and stops) b) on the bus stops (there is only direction and two or three stops and that is not enough)
175	very dissatisfied	Bus not breaking down getting off, getting on another bus, I was running late totally stressed
176	very satisfied	Satisfied.
177	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Add more stops routes to the journey
178	very dissatisfied	Your drivers to be clean and tidy and more pleasant
179	fairly satisfied	Announcements saying the next stop.
180	fairly satisfied	Electronic display of bus arrival time at bus stop would be useful.
181	fairly satisfied	My journey would have been better if buses were for schoolchildren with lots of schoolbags. And buses for public.  It's a danger for senior people.
182	fairly satisfied	More leg room when sitting must sit sideways to be comfortable
183	fairly satisfied	Hi sir   I am telling about the time   Sir last week I wait 30 minutes on bus stop the bus time is 20:00 and bus cam 20:40 I can't no way   Thanks
184	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The prices of the bus fare when only a little journey.
185	fairly satisfied	Smoothness of the Journey.
186	fairly dissatisfied	At present there is no contact between Henhead Road and Gloucester Road.  This route is far too long.
187	fairly dissatisfied	The length, too slow and too many stops. A recurring issue is that the bus comes late without any apology-it's expected. This is the supposedly 16:10 service from Milton Keynes Central Station which always come late. The bus needs announcements for each bus stop too, there is a complete lack of information inside the bus.
188	fairly satisfied	Cheaper fares, getting almost the same as a taxi.
189	fairly satisfied	Better seats at bus stop
190	fairly satisfied	Relating to Q30, I was able to get a seat," otherwise it would be ""very dissatisfied""."
191	fairly satisfied	Cheaper return ticket.
192	fairly satisfied	The prices of the ticket, I'm 16 I should pay child but I have to pay adult.
193	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	A more direct route
194	fairly satisfied	Better road conditions on Battery Hill and Fairlight Road
195	fairly dissatisfied	Punctuality is everything, makes no difference how much a bus or driver it is if it's late.
196	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Less grumpy bus drivers
197	fairly satisfied	The bus itself was quite old and didn't have some of the comforts of the newer buses, leather seats for instance. Also, there wasn't enough leg room between the seats.
198	fairly satisfied	Not to have backward facing seats.
199	fairly satisfied	Just some better stops so that the stop isn't on a massive curve
200	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Nothing to comment on.  Early buses are fine but not the problem.  Daytime / evening buses are a major problem.
201	fairly satisfied	Frequently travel on bus. Driver usually not engaging and no greeting when offering fare.
202	fairly satisfied	An information on screen - location of bus in relation to the route. Have to check app to see when stop is coming up.
203	fairly satisfied	The cleanliness of the bus which is probably very hard to maintain.
204	fairly dissatisfied	The bus to be on time.  I missed my connecting bus to work due to Stagecoach bus being ten minutes late.
205	fairly satisfied	digital information at the bus stop to indicate arrival time of the bus would be helpful
206	fairly satisfied	Think it would be good to have student fares because I have to travel to and from Exeter College everyday, which is very expensive
207	fairly satisfied	To run longer into the night.
208	fairly satisfied	Walking stick set for elderly or people with bad leg or walking and space for push chair passengers and helpful drivers
209	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Leaving on time as I have to pick up my children from school and it's frustrating when the bus leaves late.
210	very satisfied	Bus Times timetable at the bus stop    Accessibility for the Blind
211	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Would have been happier, if the bus I went to the stop for had turned up. Everyone was upset.
212	very satisfied	It was ok.
213	fairly satisfied	Buses should be on time especially in the morning because some of us have to catch another bus journey to work as well in the morning and also in the evenings when miss a bus have to wait extremely long.  One hour and a half to wait  mostly as don't get home until midnight.
214	fairly satisfied	Journey was pleasant. There are issues with feeling safe at and around bus stops but do not feel this is controllable by the bus company
215	fairly satisfied	Driver would lower bus. As he explained he pushed button but did not work. I have chronic osteoarthritis. My spine, feet, knees, and hips so as I was standing too long I just wanted a seat.
216	fairly satisfied	Bus was not on time
217	very dissatisfied	Time-keeping, starting on time (late start due the driver having a smoke).
218	fairly dissatisfied	Could you drive carefully and gently please???
219	very dissatisfied	Driver didn't give me time to get off.  Started moving before I got to door,  then no apology-blamed me! Also wish a route from triangle up Cobden Avenue to Witts Hill reinstated, was served for sixty years now so far to walk to bus stop.
220	fairly satisfied	Would prefer a bus to go to the marina from West View, Clavering area.
221	fairly satisfied	As I am blind, a lot of these questions are irrelevant but would say that 99% of the drivers do not put the trackers on to say what stop is coming up next so have to guess when to get off bus or ask strangers. Could be better.
222	fairly satisfied	Bus arrived late, driver in no hurry to catch his time up. Service always late to work and back.
223	fairly satisfied	That I could have a key card that rolls over from month to month. For both myself and my children. Do not lose what is left at the end of the month.
224	very satisfied	Satisfied with the bus service
225	very satisfied	Very satisfied.
226	fairly satisfied	The bus should be clean at all times or put disposable bin. Bag on the bus for rubbish or passengers take rubbish with them.
227	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	64/64A was due 14:49/14:59/15:09. I arrived at the stop 14:48 and was told the 64A due at 14:49 hadn't arrived yet. The next bus showed at 15:07. This happens regularly in Colchester.
228	fairly satisfied	Less time spent chatting when changing drivers at depot, although on this bus today they didn't change but in general sometimes I'm sat a good ten minutes when changing drivers.
229	fairly satisfied	I experienced in the past that No 8 bus at the certain time it was skipped and it was coming the next one in the next twenty minutes.
230	fairly satisfied	The punctuality of the buses.
231	fairly satisfied	Better time spacing of buses.  After waiting so long on a ten minute service two arrived together at my destination.
232	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Do not always acknowledge passengers sat at stop.  Missed on couple of occasions.  More care needs to be taken when checking stops for passengers.
233	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	A more up to date and comfortable bus that didn't rattle and shake about
234	fairly dissatisfied	The buses are not punctual at all. It takes to long to board the buses because it is incredibly inefficient to buy the ticket on the bus.
235	very satisfied	both drivers were lovely, both have good advice regarding journey (we aren't from this area). The only downside was we had no idea if our little boy would get out of the bus (due to loving the experience).
236	fairly satisfied	The wifi could be improved, bus could stop at less stops on the route
237	fairly satisfied	On return from hospital students on all disabled seats.  Some elderly people hanging to the side seats where chairs and babies go.
238	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus heaters were on and it was too warm- should have been turned off.
239	fairly satisfied	Evening timings also buses increases is required. It means travelling of buses in the evenings is frequently now it must be increased as possible.
240	fairly satisfied	Electronic display was not working.
241	fairly satisfied	The number 5 to be more frequent again 15 min instead of 30 mins
242	fairly satisfied	Total ban on eating and drinking on buses especially by school children.
243	fairly satisfied	Replacing the vehicles with more frequency rather than keep repairing.
244	very satisfied	It was a short journey, nothing coming onto mind
245	fairly dissatisfied	Put a direct bus to Knowle like you did before with the 379 from Roadstock to Knowle then onto Bristol bus station PLEASE.
246	very dissatisfied	Not to let too many trolleys on, tell people with trolleys not to take up two seats instead of sitting on edge aisle seat, move along where possible !!
247	fairly satisfied	Bus was a little cold, but it is November
248	very dissatisfied	The number 2 bus is never on time from 4PM onwards.  Do you think we don't have lives and families to go home to. I have had to get three Ubers home in the last two months costing ?11-14 each time, it is a joke and should be addressed .
249	fairly satisfied	Shorter journey time too many stops on journey more reliability of service rarely runs on time timetabe means nothing
250	fairly satisfied	All drivers approach bus stops too quickly. Generally, when destination / bus times are displayed on a screen they are often incorrect
251	fairly satisfied	If only the driver would slow down more on the Bitmac ramps in the Penryn campus.
252	fairly satisfied	WIFI is available however never tends to work.
253	fairly satisfied	The price of single ticket (even brought with the app) is too much for shorter trips especially.
254	fairly satisfied	It was overcrowded. Many people standing or sitting on the stairs.
255	fairly satisfied	1. Lighting around bus steps. 2. Ticket price - it is cheaper for a day return to Maidstone (?5) than it is to go ten to fifteen minutes from Sutton Valence to Headcorn/Tenterden. A standard return is considerably higher which seems unfair. Please look into this
256	fairly satisfied	Not to be able to hear the driver swearing at the traffic because I had my daughter with me. If pushchairs didn't block the walkway.
257	fairly satisfied	I sit near the front of the bus and was surrounded by people standing.  I think this can be improved by providing more buses at that time of day.
258	very satisfied	Nothing could be improved. The drivers are always friendly and helpful!
259	fairly satisfied	As I use a folding roll later I seem to fall between places on the bus I need a seat as my knees can give way and I can't get up.
260	fairly dissatisfied	Drivers taking their time and not speeding when late and some can be very rude too and give attitude, they need to be more helpful
261	fairly satisfied	I would love the bus journey to be shorter.
262	fairly satisfied	The drivers could be more friendly when we say thank you to them.
263	fairly satisfied	More room for shopping trollies as driver delayed as having to wait while people with trollies and buggies tried to move them into a place. 55 passengers had room to get on and off the bus which means driver cannot pull away as many trolley user are elderly or disable.
264	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Waiting time and traffic problems. More bus shelters (e.g. York Courts for elderly)
265	very dissatisfied	Explain why my bus was late and others didn't turn up
266	fairly satisfied	More frequent services, display at bus stops working so I know when the bus would come it's been broken a lot of the times
267	very satisfied	Nothing the journey was fine.
268	fairly satisfied	Not having youths putting their feet on the seats.
269	fairly satisfied	197 takes far too long. That compared to other buses.
270	fairly satisfied	Time of arrival of bus from Asda (Minworth) frequently late
271	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Arriving on time. 17 bus is never on time, sometimes not even turn up. 2-3 buses at the same time.
272	fairly satisfied	Temperature on board is too warm .  Time it takes to get out of Lincoln.  Better queuing system in Bus Station, everyone just pushes in when bus arrives.
273	very dissatisfied	Have a bus that doesn't keep breaking down. Get a driver that isn't rude and stops at stops they are supposed to. Also is a safe driver, this company has a small blue mini bus. This driver won't let me on with walker. I have to walk.
274	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Clean inside and outside windows. USB charge points on x4/x5 routes like E1/E2.
275	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Not a very appealing bus inside and is due maintenance. Bus come every hour, maybe should be every thirty minutes.
276	fairly satisfied	More frequent buses.
277	fairly dissatisfied	A shorter journey.  The 104 goes to and from Thorpe Astley and goes through Braunston e, every little road through there, it is ridiculous and takes fifty minutes too.  It's great having buses every thirty minutes but the journey time has more than doubled.  Thorpe Astley is growing , it's about time it had it's own route..
278	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Drivers attitude/manner can at times be contrary to good service.
279	very satisfied	I was happy.
280	very satisfied	All good including our free travel pass
281	very satisfied	All good driver was excellent.
282	fairly satisfied	Cleanliness of the bus and seats.  National Express have a cleaning team who pay attention to cleanliness
283	fairly satisfied	For drivers to look more carefully at the Jane Street stop sometimes they go right past.
284	fairly satisfied	The service has improved a lot recently. Always on time and the drivers are much more affable.
285	fairly satisfied	More information on the bus.
286	fairly dissatisfied	For the number 2 service to be more on time. Turn up. I live at the end of journey. There were 3 buses here last week there were 5 on the terminal and packed along roadside.
287	very satisfied	On this particular trip no problems whatsoever.
288	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Some drivers are a bit abrupt and not helpful with passengers , they need to be more courteous and help more people who are disabled or some vulnerable elderly passengers.
289	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	not to take as long to get to Newark and have them more regularly
290	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Now I never miss a bus. Most of the times the bus will not come then we have to wait for the next bus. Children then get late to school!
291	fairly satisfied	This journey was a rare exception. Although it still arrived late, it was nowhere near as late as it usually is. On this occasion the bus driver was polite. Not very cheerful but far less rude +abrupt than usual. Usually when late, there is no apology/explanation whilst driver seems fed up. Buses on this route rush around, throwing the over-crowded bus around turns to make up time as they have to return again often over-filled with people practically standing on each other
292	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Passengers should be prevented from standing upstairs and sitting on the stairs. On this particular journey there were some very rowdy school children blocking stiars behind and being very rude when asked by passengers to move.
293	very satisfied	Air conditioning.
294	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Use newer buses. Buses that lower to get on and off buses. Buses that don't break down a lot. In the last six months I've to wait one hour for another bus and get taxis on two occasion. Five break downs. Bus our route are really uncomfortable.
295	very dissatisfied	The buses are a disgrace. They are old and worn out, and very uncomfortable.
296	very satisfied	All good service.
297	fairly satisfied	To display about information about next stop, company contact number and so on. During the winter time this bus doesn't come on time and it's very cold to wait outside, I would prefer the bus to be quicker I understand the traffic jam but also we got children as well.
298	fairly satisfied	Lower price (?2.90 for three miles).
299	fairly satisfied	Over crowding and noise pollution.
300	very satisfied	Its all right as it is. Thank you.
301	fairly satisfied	This service is very unpredictable  sometimes the bus doesn't run at the predicted times.
302	fairly satisfied	Heat off and the windows open. More at stop, not just sign with bus number.
303	fairly satisfied	The price fares have gone up again! Nearly ?5 for a day ticket is a joke
304	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More buses on my route. Thank you.
305	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	If the bus could get to Q.E a few minutes earlier, It would be a big improvement as I am nearly always late for work. Less waiting at Kings Norton station and a faster journey. Also cleaner seats upstairs.
306	fairly satisfied	Better buses or newer ones and not stopping into town on Carlton Hill. We have only one bus, they have several.
307	fairly dissatisfied	Bus actually arriving on time, in the morning the bus is usually twenty minutes late.
308	fairly satisfied	Bus parking properly at bus stops
309	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	A schoolgirl with something that made a noise like a cap gun until an adult passenger asked her to stop.  Not threatening, just annoying.
310	fairly satisfied	Run longer on weekends
311	fairly satisfied	The heat from inside the bus was extremely warm and made it a bit difficult to breathe. This didn't help me being lightheaded.
312	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	71 and 16 arrive about the same time at the bus stop.  It would be better to stagger these times giving a better service.  Folkestone Bus Station -71 should arrive and depart at the same stop as the No.16 on it's way to Canterbury.
313	fairly dissatisfied	Bus N4 need to be improved. The timetable should be changed. The bus should run every 10 minutes between 2.30pm and 5.00pm
314	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The frequency of this bus should be improved.
315	fairly satisfied	More room on bus, was crowded. More frequent buses between airport and city centre
316	fairly satisfied	I find the seating too high.
317	fairly dissatisfied	The driver did not know stops, people were asking for tickets to destinations.  He did not seem to be very helpful on this either causing people to get annoyed.
318	fairly dissatisfied	Drivers getting off at 3 or 4 stops reading the metro news paper when you're trying to get to work + driving slowly.
319	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	That first buses actually turn up on time.
320	very satisfied	Nothing, maybe  USB charging points, included on our bus.
321	fairly satisfied	A larger bus
322	fairly satisfied	Interior of bus being cleaner.
323	fairly dissatisfied	Time arrival 15-16 mins late. Cold day.
