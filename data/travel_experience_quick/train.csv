0	fairly satisfied	Stop near to kerb as have bad legs and wait till people sit down.
1	fairly satisfied	20 minute late could be improved
2	fairly satisfied	If you'd asked me all this on my journey into town I would be putting very satisfied for both smoothness and safety .  Very jerky , quick braking and movement was abrasive when dodging other buses on the Boothferry Estate.  The journey was fine though.
3	fairly satisfied	Too many stops on the route. You no sooner leave one stop than you are at the next. It means the bus is constantly stopping and starting. Plus the lengthy stops outside McVities. Plus in a morning the number of students getting on at Stockport precinct makes it hard to then get off at my stop.
4	very satisfied	Ok.
5	very dissatisfied	Punctuality. Better trained drivers on new bus
6	fairly satisfied	Bus being on time.
7	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The cleanliness of the inside of the bus and the windows cleaned. The drivers lowering the floor for you to get on and of f, allowing time for you to sit down and get off. Stopping people putting their feet on seat and legs on seats.
8	fairly dissatisfied	74 to arrive on time.
9	fairly satisfied	Single passengers taking up a whole seat, by either sitting on the edge or placing their bags there
10	very satisfied	Impossible to improve anything.  Trent Barton provide excellent service.

13	very satisfied	No comment as all is good
14	fairly satisfied	Not a complaint but the drivers change over very often during shifts. Some like to natter for a goods five minutes sometimes!
15	very satisfied	This was a nice pleasant journey , I would have liked a later service from Bewdley on the 294 to have avoided Kidderminster.
16	fairly dissatisfied	A busy route used by many people often. 10pm full bus within no seating every night
17	fairly satisfied	This form does not account for drivers and at different times.  The bus can be quite late, no seating facility at some bus stops.  It would be good to have a half hourly town service.  Again at the south end of Gainsboro.
18	very dissatisfied	Students could have given me a seat.
19	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Some information on the times on the bus.
20	fairly satisfied	Bring back old crew at least the bus was always on time smartly dressed always pleasant and helpful.
21	fairly dissatisfied	The 25 bus route is always bad time keeping at arrival at bus stop.  Always bad.

24	very satisfied	Totally satisfied on this journey, sometimes can be a problem i.e. movement when getting off the bus.
25	fairly satisfied	To give time for parents to sit down with little children before driving off. My little girl ( 2 year old) fell forward because the driver didn't wait till we sat down.
26	fairly satisfied	So that everyone understands signage due to foreign students having signs in multiple languages would 've helpful.
27	very satisfied	It would be very hard to improve.
28	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Make the 18 every 30 minutes.
29	fairly dissatisfied	For buses to turn up on time or have a between time on timetable / traffic updates 64A bus to run earlier for people who work
30	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The time I boarded the bus at Sainsbury's supermarket to getting to the park and ride site varies so much that one day I can transfer to the bus in front. Another day I can be sat on the bus until they decides it's time to go - consistency
31	fairly dissatisfied	Not having to get two buses to college and back home
32	fairly satisfied	Very bumpy and shaky, felt ill.
33	very dissatisfied	Arriva is the worst bus company I've ever used.  Buses are never on time, finding info on site is so difficult , bus stations aren't labelled correctly and they wait ages at bus stops and I'm always late.  It is a shock to ever be home only or on time .
34	fairly satisfied	Bus maintained not breaking down.
35	fairly satisfied	Time to sit down as being pregnant while the bus moved makes me jolt.
36	fairly satisfied	Bus stop too far out in town, when you have heavy shopping - they have moved it too far down.

38	very satisfied	Nothing the journey was fine
39	fairly satisfied	Stopping near the raised Kerb side as this impossible with the community buses.

43	fairly satisfied	More frequent buses. Later in the evening buses.
44	fairly satisfied	punctuality of bus, and getting to the destination when it is supposed to get there
45	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More room for scooter, drivers more helpful towards a mobility customer
46	fairly satisfied	The bus route that I used to take from home was cut out any runs from 9:30 to 2:30 and I work 9 to 5. The 36 route needs to be put back on to save hours to get multiple buses everyday.
47	fairly dissatisfied	The bus being on time
48	very satisfied	Very satisfied.
49	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Some of the drivers are very rude and unhelpful, many times I have been upset by their attitude. I use the buses everyday and I can honestly say I am mainly disaapointed with the service
50	fairly satisfied	The amount of space you have with someone sat next to you
51	very satisfied	Very happy with 1X service. When you catch other buses i.e. 21 and 16, bus seats are covered in filth
52	fairly satisfied	Today everything was ok as it was a short journey
53	fairly satisfied	Been on time I was late for work.
54	fairly dissatisfied	Windows could be cleaner, beautiful views on some routes in Cornwall but windows always dirty.
55	fairly satisfied	This journey was generally good the driver seemed to be sharp on accelerating/braking at times.
56	fairly satisfied	More space on bus.  More seats.
57	very dissatisfied	The No 8 to Manchester is never ever on time. They're supposed to frequent every ten minutes and may not even arrive for forty five minutes at a time, at which point two will arrive following behind each other for the rest of the journey.
58	fairly satisfied	Everywhere I go I have to get two buses.  It was not the only bus I had to board to get to Kings Heath.  I also had to get the No.11 which I had to wait twenty minutes for then two turned up together.  No bus shelters on the No.1 or No.2 route where I live.
59	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Be there on time ALWAYS!
60	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	A lot of people generally get on so a single decker is inadequate for the journey
61	fairly satisfied	Didn't take as long to get to my destination
62	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Drivers not to be too serious just showing a happy face.
63	very satisfied	Nothing at all (good service and value for money)
64	fairly dissatisfied	Buses to turn up on time, or not to come in threes and not to have buses missing and drivers not caring how long you have waited.
65	fairly satisfied	More up to date information
66	fairly dissatisfied	The buses sticking to the timetable. The 57 should come eight to ten minutes. The company doesn't stick to timetable. Have waited a long time then two or three buses turn up at the same time.
67	fairly dissatisfied	Bus on time .  Cleaner bus .  Giving schoolkids their own bus.
68	very satisfied	Nothing, very satisfied.
69	fairly dissatisfied	Delays due to roadworks - no communication. No communication at Bus stops regularly diverted bus routes! Accesibility of some bus stops are very poor for wheelchair users like my son.
70	fairly satisfied	More seats/additional services at this time of day due to amount of school children having to use the bus, most of these children do not get seats. Have to stand and make it difficult for others to leave the bus
71	fairly dissatisfied	Put more double decker buses. You could improve this when school is on.
72	fairly satisfied	Always have announcements of the next stop coming     Have some information about the fare on the bus stops, I never know how much money I need
73	fairly satisfied	The driver - aiming to come in close to the kerb later stopping - twice hit the kerb itself - no problem for the passengers but it would scrape the bus.
74	fairly satisfied	You have a lot of people working till late so make the bus stay active till 10pm at least.
75	very satisfied	Nothing could be improved, excellent service.
76	fairly satisfied	More bus times! If I was rating the morning journey, this would be a lot more depressing.  Never on time  (by 15 minutes +) rude and cold.
77	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The bus to keep time, particularly during peak times!
78	fairly satisfied	Price of ticket for only moving two stops is stupidly high.
79	fairly satisfied	The bus came five minutes late.
80	fairly satisfied	Not to be overcrowded at front of bus.
81	fairly dissatisfied	Punctuality - bus was 15 mins late
82	very satisfied	I was satisfied. Have in the past objected to teenager with feet on seats.
83	fairly satisfied	The bus from Severn Beach is usually ten to twenty minuteslate all day!
84	fairly satisfied	Routes 5 and 6 are usually late most days. Punctuality needs improving
85	very dissatisfied	All transport need to have a good shake up.
86	very satisfied	Good journey
87	fairly satisfied	More space.
88	fairly satisfied	Bus being on time .  Why two buses arrive together , greeting by driver , boarding and disembarking.
89	fairly satisfied	Last week the  bus did not come. I was at the bus stop from 9:50 to 10:15am. This was very disappointing.
90	very dissatisfied	If the buses pass on the other side of the road, the first bus has been delayed. It should leave the terminus straight away so it is not late.
91	fairly satisfied	For buses to arrive on time.
92	fairly satisfied	My bus stop  was closed due to builders.  Could not a temporary stop been available a few yards down the road. The builders seem to be in no hurry finishing this job.
93	fairly satisfied	this journey was great but usually the bus drivers are not friendly and do not really speak to customers
94	fairly dissatisfied	Stopping some of the passengers from smoking and playing loud music and littering
95	fairly satisfied	It would be good if the buses on this route were on time like today every time and also if it ran on a Saturday.
96	very dissatisfied	The traffic a long plum rock
97	fairly dissatisfied	Bus 5 is almost late every time, especially during school runs, seems to be unreliable to use it for kids school. Can do better
98	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Make sure heating is on. If bus is at the beginning of the journey let passengers on don't kick them out in the cold and wet.
99	very satisfied	Lovely driver, good service
100	very satisfied	Cannot think of anything.
101	very satisfied	On this journey (nothing)
102	very satisfied	All good.
103	fairly dissatisfied	Punctuality of the bus.
104	very satisfied	Naming next bus stop to help those unfamiliar with the route
105	fairly dissatisfied	more frequent buses around college hours, they get too full and dive past people who are then late
106	fairly dissatisfied	Charging ports working, less dirty.
107	fairly dissatisfied	It takes too long!
108	fairly satisfied	More cheerful driver.
109	fairly satisfied	I'm deaf so can't hear the bell when pressed. I rely on the visual signal "stopping" When this is not working I don't know if the bell is working.
110	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus being on time. Bus being able to pull in at current bus stop at station - had to stop in middle of road - not safe!
111	fairly satisfied	Give us time to sit down before moving off in 83.
112	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The price, I don't feel that the inflation of the bus service fare justifies the bus service.
113	fairly satisfied	Availability of space around bus stop, very overly crowded in new bus stop previously on Colmore Raw.
114	fairly satisfied	Congestion, jams.
115	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	I usually have panic attacks so if I was to get off it would be nice for the driver to make sure I was OK.  Also later running times.
116	fairly dissatisfied	Bus driver didn't smile or talk apart from telling me the cost of the fare.
117	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The number one bus is a joke. Nine times out of ten it is always running late. There is room for improvement
118	very satisfied	Not to take so long
119	fairly dissatisfied	Bus turning up on time .  Bus not being overcrowded with people.  Stood next to door.
120	fairly dissatisfied	Heating. Very rattled journey.
121	very satisfied	n/a , very happy
122	very satisfied	Nothing. Thank you all. Keep up with the good work.
123	fairly satisfied	An updated timetable or live information online would be helpful for while the major roadworks are on. I take this bus every day and it varies from being on time, and up to 40 mins late.
124	very satisfied	Nothing - its perfect.
125	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The drivers are scruffy unhelpful their dress is some what to be desired the buses are frequently breaking down and sometimes don't turn up
126	fairly satisfied	On this particular journey was ok, but when I get the bus after school times, sometimes drivers ignore you, and let too many people on. So I am worried I won't be able to get my kids off safely.
127	fairly satisfied	Today was one of the rare good days travelling on the 350 as it was only ten minutes late.  Frequently people including the elderly and mums with young children end up waiting for up to an hour in which time three buses should have arrived and not one does.  I have frequently had to pay my childcare provider more fees because the 350 has caused me to be late collecting my children after work. It's a terrible, terrible service.
128	fairly satisfied	All special locations at the stop to be announced.
129	very satisfied	Satisfied
130	fairly dissatisfied	Better bus.
131	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Cleanliness. Running on time.
132	fairly satisfied	Speeding to the next stop then heavy breaking jolts all the passengers on bus.
133	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Punctuality on the 44/45 please.
134	fairly satisfied	The driver needs to shut up talking to colleagues. The bus was actually running late, yet still had a 3 minutes chat with the previous driver. Why?
135	fairly satisfied	More buses (79)on route after 18.00
136	fairly satisfied	I found 84 return too expensive!
137	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Cheaper
138	fairly satisfied	The Number 1 route at Broomhill is the only bus and I regularly stand at bus stop long periods because one or two do not turn up.
139	fairly dissatisfied	The bus arrive on time.
140	fairly satisfied	I live in Wecock and there could be at least two buses running on a Sunday and during the week at least one bus a day that goes straight through to Havant, also buses need better air conditioning during summer
141	very satisfied	Nothing every thing was good
142	very satisfied	Nothing could have been changed. Very satisfied.
143	very dissatisfied	Bus could have run on time.  Took same route, both directions on same day, both twenty plus minutes late.
144	fairly satisfied	Comfortable seats and next stop announcements and arrives quicker.
145	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	In general bus drivers jerk and I have received shoulder injury due to this in the past. Please allow for elderly passengers
146	very satisfied	Nothing at all it was a pleasant journey.
147	fairly satisfied	A little more heat on the bus to dispel condensation. Arriving on time would have bean better.
148	fairly satisfied	Having to pay less for the bus journeys! Far too expensive for short trips!!
149	fairly satisfied	Allow passengers to sit before moving on.
150	fairly satisfied	Accurate real time info on app. It is very rarely correct. Sometimes it says bus has passed my stop before it has got there!
151	fairly satisfied	Daytime timetables for the number five are good but evening time tables if they could come 10 past the hour that would be great because a lot of people finish work on the hour and we have to wait at least 50 minutes for the bus to come to take us home
152	fairly satisfied	Make the bus come on time!!
153	very satisfied	An electronic display showing next stop.
154	fairly satisfied	Buses being on time.  More regular.  Shorter wait at Vanguard Park and Ride stop
155	fairly satisfied	Electronic display showing next stop because it is dark nights now, when travelling back home from work.  Hard to see where you are.
156	fairly satisfied	Need the driver to keep an eye on when seats are full, not to pull at stops and have people standing up.  If we crash the people standing up will get harmed as well as those who are seated.  It will be the driver who'd get the blame.
157	fairly satisfied	The electronic display at the bus stop showed the scheduled times , not the actual times.
158	fairly satisfied	Temperature on board - too hot.
159	fairly satisfied	There are too many bus stops on route down Saffron Lane.
160	fairly satisfied	Not applicable  to this particular journey - BUT very important to every driver to wait until passengers are actually seated. Bus jolts have caused a number of people to fall and be injured.
161	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus not being late
162	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	I feel the service could of worked better around roads as I rely on public transport and sometimes need to travel to the hospital and need to get there on time.
163	very satisfied	Can't think of anything this bus service is really good
164	fairly satisfied	When the minibus go over the bump it's totally ridiculous - hurts you badly
165	fairly satisfied	If the buses were spaced further apart rather than ten minutes.
166	very satisfied	Nothing everything was perfect.
167	fairly satisfied	Said good morning to driver.  No response .  However the driver is not alone in this, others are the same .  Some drivers do not even look at passengers boarding , however the female drivers are much more pleasant.
168	fairly satisfied	On arrival at the stop, previous left the stop nearly 5 mins before advertised time, so, as I arrived, he had just pulled off
169	fairly satisfied	Smoother ride, access from upper deck at stops, access to upper deck at stop.
170	very satisfied	Bus service perfectly ok as it is at present.
171	fairly satisfied	Would like maybe one or two more no. 21 bus to go to the Valley as pensioners and disabled persons not able to walk up hills.
172	fairly satisfied	The driver was very heavy with the use of the brakes when it came to stopping for myself and wife he stopped more than a foot away from the kerb.  My wife did have difficulty alighting from the bus because of distance from the kerb and bus step.
173	fairly satisfied	Its poor that now that we have no shelter at or near the airport bus, people with cases wont have spare hands for umbrella and site is very exposed with no shelter or seats for elderly or infants.
174	very satisfied	A new bus!
175	fairly satisfied	The bus to arrive on time, less buses being randomly cancelled.
176	fairly satisfied	Noise of windows shaking
177	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Arrive on time , no delays or arriving too early
178	fairly satisfied	Some drivers don't say, in fact most drivers don't say anything, say hello or thanks.
179	very dissatisfied	This is not a true representation of this service as I thought it strange the bus arrived on time! Also could be quicker by missing Garforth out.
180	fairly satisfied	A double decker bus would have given more choice of seats and more space. Neighbouring passenger seemed unaware of need to afford me more space.
181	very satisfied	Nothing everything was fine
182	fairly satisfied	Otford has only two buses a day which allowed you to get home by bus. Old people have to stay in Sevenoaks. Two more buses a day would help.
183	fairly satisfied	They should tell all the drivers to be at the bus stop at right times.
184	very satisfied	Nothing thanks.
185	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus punctuality is atrocious every day at least one bus I get on is missed out and the ones that are generally If you complaint you are ignored or fobbed off.
186	fairly satisfied	To allow contactless debit card payments on bus.  The swift card is more of a nightmare than I understood when it was advertised .  Finding collection centres is tedious.
187	fairly satisfied	Too hot on buses.
188	fairly satisfied	Changing drivers take ages.
189	very satisfied	Nothing needed to be improved.
190	fairly satisfied	Bus was old and a bit shaky.
191	fairly dissatisfied	The driver didn't stop for me even though I was standing outside the shelter waiting for me bus, he stopped further on when someone obviously told him I was waiting at me stop. The improvement would be slowing down on approaching every stop to make sure not to miss anyone.
192	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The bus wasn't the normal purple line 87 bus, it was a yellow line single bus which are smaller
193	fairly dissatisfied	The bus should have shown up on time, instead of having two buses at the same time.   Have a reason why there is a delay.
194	fairly satisfied	Stopping closer to the kerb. Lowering bus without asking. Young men driver not to drive as if in a race track. It is very scary for disable
195	fairly satisfied	Drivers have more respect and stop treating some good some bad treat all of us. Feel  some. Love and respect more.
196	fairly satisfied	Fewer stops  and nicer bus (like other routes in Oxford ) NB cool day, in summer this bus is unbearable
197	very satisfied	We are grateful to our bus drivers for their care. Drivers in Sidmouth and area are mostly very helpful and kind. They are narrow streets to contend with.
198	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Time it takes to get out of bus station.
199	fairly satisfied	Many bus stops I use have live information that is not working regularly
200	fairly satisfied	Seats to sit down, it was crowded, need more X1 services.
201	fairly satisfied	Braking should be smooth not a last minute activity each stop. Some trips I feel like I have had my internal organs rearranged!
202	fairly satisfied	Just get the temperature right - if its cold then there is often no heating but in the summer its going full blast!
203	fairly satisfied	Frequent services after 18
204	fairly satisfied	More punctuality. In the morning journey the bus often doesn't turn up 06:36 service.
205	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The Y5 to Nottingham from Derby bus station was due at 17.25 and did not arrive until the next bus was due at approx 17.45. There was no information given about where the bus was or to expect delays although these kind of delays are very regular. When significant delays can be expected at particular times of day or during particular roadworks for example, there should be an obvious notice about this at bus stops/bus stations on the timetables or electronic screens.
206	very satisfied	Have poles on the front in the front to hold onto when getting off.
207	very satisfied	Only concern is how close the bus stop is to a busy main road - doesn't feel safe when large vehicles come past.
208	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Not have a paper map on the steering wheel and know where there going
209	very satisfied	good journey
210	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Turn up on time.
211	very satisfied	Very satisfied as it was.
212	very satisfied	Good driving.
213	fairly satisfied	Info about why the bus was late
214	fairly satisfied	Drivers on Stagecoach are rude ignorant.
215	fairly satisfied	Buses are old and often break down. On the upside they always provide a replacement bus but they do need upgrading.
216	fairly satisfied	That we didn't have a collision with a car.
217	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The amount of them gave not turned up, having to wait a couple of hours because no bus to arrive to pick up passengers?
218	very satisfied	nothing it was completely seamless
219	very satisfied	The bus driver is friendly.
220	very satisfied	Nothing everything was fine
221	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Tell the driver to make eye contact when putting bus pass on machine. Why are bus drivers so sad and unhappy?
222	fairly satisfied	Coming on time
223	fairly satisfied	All was good but you do not ask about Sunday services , evening services or services to the hospital and the time for clean electric buses is here now !
224	fairly satisfied	The pricing structure is unnecessarily complicated. Fare prices have increased well beyond inflation in recent years.
225	fairly satisfied	Some driver need to be more polite
226	very satisfied	No there was nothing to improve upon, excellent journey.
227	fairly dissatisfied	A better and quicker route to get from Shipley to Bradford.
228	very satisfied	No complaints.  Good service all round.  Some of the passengers should be better.  Bus employees first class.
229	very satisfied	It was all very satisfactory
230	fairly satisfied	The bus being on time
231	fairly satisfied	300 doesn't usually come quick.
232	fairly satisfied	Reliability of buses - tend to run very early or very late!
233	fairly satisfied	On the outwards journey from deanshanger (89) at 10.07, it didn't bother turning up. So bearing in my mind these buses only come once an hour. I had to stand and wait for 1 hour 20 mins for the 11.08 to come which came at 11.20. Being heavily pregnant this was not good for me and gave me some discomfort. This is happened all week at 10.08 which is not acceptable  on such a journey where the buses are not frequent.  I spoke with stage coach who didn't seem to care that this has happened all week and caused discomfort  to a lot of people.
234	fairly satisfied	Bus was very full so double decker on this route in daytime would help.
235	fairly dissatisfied	Bus should arrive on time.
236	very satisfied	Nothing to complain about
237	fairly satisfied	Bus smelt of urine.  Not very nice.
238	fairly satisfied	Don't let enormous buggies on as they block wheelchair access but they don't care. It's a me me me world.
239	fairly satisfied	Come more often.
240	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	the buses should be on time and not 4/5 mins late
241	fairly satisfied	Sometime the bus just missing, it should be every fifteen minutes a bus so I did wait for thirty minutes for the bus, that's even not talking about on time or not, the bus just disappear.
242	very dissatisfied	Sunday Number 8 bus doesn't always turns up. It's never on time. Week days Number 8 bus morning don't always turn up and have to call a cab or wait.
243	fairly satisfied	There are no bus shelters in Favell Drive
244	fairly satisfied	The bus driver could have smiled and spoken to you. He looked miserable and not very welcoming
245	fairly satisfied	The happiness of the passengers! More serious in comparison to other buses I have used in UK and internationally. There is little room for improvement.
246	fairly satisfied	More space for elderly's' shopping, baby push chair and fold up walking aids.
247	very satisfied	No complaints.  Thanks for a pleasant journey
248	very dissatisfied	Far too packed. Dangerous as very busy route. This often occurs, two buses came  together . No seat available, seats too small.
249	fairly satisfied	If the bus did not take too long to come.
250	fairly satisfied	Waiting in town too long
251	very dissatisfied	need more 512 bus instead of 1 every 30 mins as 521 get one every 10 mins with brilliant bus company go past as 512 only get 1 only up Pillow Lane Halifax W Yorks
252	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus coming on time, its always mostly late which makes me late for lesson. Also need some sort of bus shelter because there's no cover from the rain and you get soaked.
253	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More comfortable seats on the newer buses. The seats height is so high I cant reach the floor! Making long journeys is uncomfortable. Would like a Sunday service + evenings too.
254	fairly dissatisfied	The amount of room you are given for a pushchair
255	fairly satisfied	On narrow residential road action taken to remove large vehicles making driving difficult for drivers.
256	fairly satisfied	The stand where I board the 156 is shared with the 320, as they both go to Ashton there is always confusion as to which queue I am in. If the 320 is late local people board the 156 which is a small bus and people going to Ashton have trouble getting on.
257	fairly satisfied	Buses never run on time.
258	fairly satisfied	Everything is pretty good
259	fairly satisfied	Buses to arrive on time and be regular.  Drivers to be polite as they are providing a service.  Smooth journey.
260	very satisfied	No need. Keep service like this and will all be happy.
261	very dissatisfied	The bus being on time and being enough room for my 2 year old son not to have to squeeze onto my lap
262	fairly satisfied	Condensation on the windows / Anti Bac would be good in winter.
263	very satisfied	None. Very good bus service. Better than 47
264	very satisfied	Nothing at all.
265	fairly satisfied	Cheaper fares and re-nationalisation of buses
266	fairly satisfied	On occasions it is too hot on the bus even during hot weather there was no air-con.
267	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	There was a lady on the seat next to me who had her bag on my seat and didn't move it when I sat down even though there were no other seats available.
268	fairly satisfied	Like to see a circular bus around Redcar to go into the estates and wait here to get 63, gets crowded sometimes.
269	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Frequency of buses and turning up on time. Have waited forty plus minutes before for one bus.
270	very dissatisfied	It would help if bus was running to time.  App was saying it was running seven minutes late
271	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More bus route, weekends often bus route, cleanliness and condition of the inside of the bus, the length of time it took to board.
272	very dissatisfied	Not having to get off the bus mid journey because the driver was so late due to hold up. I understand the reason for it but it's useless if you have an appointment to keep and you allowed enough time to get to it. This is the second time it has happened
273	very satisfied	Nothing that I can think of, it was a very good park and ride service.
274	fairly satisfied	Long Ashton Park and Ride to be reinstated , traffic normally horrendous so left early today.
275	fairly satisfied	Re-fit the real time bus info display at Somerfield South. It was removed when the post was moved a few months ago. Also provide a text code.
276	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus has been rerouted through Rawtenstall adding 20 minutes to journey time this has caused considerable inconvenience
277	fairly satisfied	This is about 10A,10 buses in general I get on at Queens Square bus station and they are supposed to be every 6 minutes. This never happens I can be at that bus stop for 30 minutes or more this is at about 7:40am . This happens nearly everyday.
278	fairly satisfied	Heating on bus was a bit cold
279	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The X30 timings have been poor 10-20 minutes late only one bus to Chester per hour at our stop. Used to be 2 an hour X30 and 21. Also bus maintenance seems lacking as breakdowns etc. alarms, in cab wipers.
280	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Hand rails overhead to hold onto.
281	fairly dissatisfied	Driving way too slow
282	very satisfied	No comment to make.
283	very satisfied	Nothing. The journey was nice and easy.
284	fairly dissatisfied	The first bus 31X for example are very old! Heating should be given priority specially for the elderly. Bus fares are too expensive! Renewable energy should be embraced for cheaper fare, buses should be changed. Solar buses as alternative.
285	fairly satisfied	As I use a mobility scooter so I have to sit with my back to the driver.  Usually I can't see out of the window.
286	fairly satisfied	By the 51 bus coming earlier near from my house and number 11 bus come earlier as well in the morning
287	very satisfied	Fairy satisfied.

293	very satisfied	Nothing. Best bus company I've rode with.
294	fairly satisfied	Better wifi connection
295	fairly satisfied	Lower ticket prices for day passes purchased on the bus. Why do you financially disadvantage those of us who don't have a smartphone + use cash.
296	fairly satisfied	Buses not reliable and do not keep to timetable. Supposed to arrive every 10 minutes but they don't.
297	fairly satisfied	Times don't match the timetable, online or bus arrival. Display sometimes shows buses that don't even show up.
298	fairly satisfied	Time it took.  Temperature in bus as hot when full.
299	very satisfied	Nothing could have been improved, very good journey, today.
300	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The 487 needs more seats or a double decker bus because it is always rammed coming back from town. I get off one of the last stops but sometimes find myself standing as there are so many people on the bus already when I first get on. Journey times also need taking into consideration because it should only take 40 minutes from my usual stop home but took 50 as of traffic. This doesn't really bother me but would suggest trying to reduce the route so that people from my area, which is furthest away, get a more efficient service.
301	fairly satisfied	Having a ban of people eating and drinking whilst on board the bus plus litter from drinks and food being left on seats and floors. Drink bottles and cans are always seen rolling from side to side on the floor with coffee plus coke etc. leaking out of them.
302	fairly satisfied	Better heating system on the bus, (was too cold)
303	fairly satisfied	Like more women drivers - help the atmosphere
304	very satisfied	Absolutely nothing.
305	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Sort out this route in general. Make buses turn
306	very satisfied	Nothing really
307	fairly satisfied	Temperature - it was colder than I wanted. Tidiness - a lot of passengers got off before I got on that had left litter from make-up products.
308	fairly satisfied	Newer buses.  This bus actually had padded seats.  Some of the buses on this route only have padded wooden seats.
309	fairly satisfied	More seats or having double decker
310	fairly dissatisfied	Slower braking and pleasant driver.
311	fairly satisfied	Electronic sign at bus stop saying when bus was coming
312	fairly satisfied	Was going to meet friends for dinner, so very low stress experience  in general and not totally bothered about journey time.
313	fairly satisfied	The length of time it takes drivers to punch in details for a ticket.
314	fairly satisfied	Braking before stops.
315	fairly satisfied	Putting a newer model bus on this route
316	fairly satisfied	At 4:10pm is ridiculous today having a single decker bus due to school children quite a few of us elderly people who no longer have our half past the hour from the bus station from Grantham, having to get on the Lincoln bus. When I needed to get off with my trolley, staggered to get by standing school children and I do this journey twice a week - 2:00pm bus weekdays and 10:00am Saturday .
317	fairly satisfied	Digital timetable working as I didn't know a bus was cancelled .  Waited an extra ten minutes for the bus to be late.
318	fairly satisfied	Only 1 bus serves Southend to Basildon going through Wickford and does not have direct route to Basildon Hospital anymore.
319	fairly satisfied	To have a bus earlier. So I can get at bus to work before 8am
320	fairly satisfied	No need for improvement - other than running to timetable/schedule.
321	very dissatisfied	Unfortunately all my experiences of the Evesham to Worcester buses (over the years) I don't rate it at all. The attitude of the drivers are absolutely disgusting. The buses don't always turn up and then when they do they never leave on time and are always leaving late. The treatment to their customers are bloody awful, Attitude of a driver.
322	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Time for the bus to arrive at least 1 hour. RUBBISH.
323	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Fewer passengers.
324	fairly satisfied	Slow down the speed of which the guided bus have is within the rails between Trumpington Park and the station. These buses have approximately 60 miles/hour and their aren't no seat belts for the passengers and no  rail/fence
325	fairly dissatisfied	Driver needs to give people longer to sit down especially travelling from college with folders / rucksacks it's hard to sit down quickly
326	fairly satisfied	The temperature of the bus, it was a very cold day and the bus wasn't much warmer.
327	fairly satisfied	A bus shelter at the stop in Wilschen just before the school as sometimes this bus is late and waiting in bad weather with kids is not good when it doesn't turn up we have to wait another half an hour.
328	fairly satisfied	Driver to not drive so fast, slow down a bit when people are trying to get off or before.
329	fairly satisfied	Being late meant I had to catch a later ferry.
330	fairly satisfied	Stop people putting bags on chairs and away from the window, so you can't sit next to them.
331	fairly satisfied	Update bus also weekend timetable on night time for getting back to Blyth
332	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Slot duplicate bus in on journey's that company know are going to get hit with heavy congestion at peak times.
333	fairly satisfied	Our 42/42A bus used to start from High Street in town centre which was very convenient for old  people but the bus station is not convenient - it is difficult to access. I have asthma,  Bus Station is supposed to be smoke free.
334	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The cleanliness of the bus. It did smell a bit. Driver was great, very friendly and helpful. WIFI does not work half the time.
335	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More space and to drive quicker.
336	fairly satisfied	This journey was fine, but too often buses on this route depart too early or too late
337	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Number 3-4 bus times are really bad.
338	very satisfied	Can't think of anything at present. It was a very satisfying journey.
339	fairly satisfied	Nothing on the bus. They have the heating on in summer but not winter.
340	very dissatisfied	Bus was moving too slow, as well as traffic congestion, waiting too long by bus stop, bus was very overcrowded and there was another behind that was empty and kept overtaking at stop.
341	fairly dissatisfied	Bus could have arrived on time.
342	fairly satisfied	1st full working day of change to route and driver not aware of new route. Had to ask each other from other buses. This delayed bus which did not stick to timetable making me late for medical appointment
343	fairly satisfied	Very bad pot holes on the 35 route in Highgate , by the shops.
344	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The timing of the bus service around a lot of slack-could be much faster , eight instead of fifteen minutes.
345	fairly satisfied	Nothing on this day but on other days, (I use this route Monday to Friday, every week), a number of people choose to stand when seats are available causing congestion at the front of the bus
346	fairly satisfied	Not including this journey but this bus itself I believe the 10A needs to improve how on time it is and make it more than 1 bus per hour it should be 2 for the convenience on us college students
347	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Better shock absorbers on bus. Oxford roads has too many bump holes etc.
348	very satisfied	Journey was good as always on this route. On this particular day an idiot drove into the side of the bus rear the end of the trip. The bus driver handled it superbly & arranged for another bus to take us onwards, so we lost only 5 min. or so. The drivers on this bus are usually punctual & helpful. We are very proud of our local bus route.
349	very satisfied	The cleanliness of the seats e.g. leather.
350	fairly dissatisfied	Newer buses with next stop electronic display. Bus shelter. Buses that do not rattle. Buses on Sundays and bank holidays and later in the evening.
351	very satisfied	Nothing at all- The driver was kind, pleasant and polite
352	very satisfied	Very good
353	fairly dissatisfied	More frequent buses around 5-6pm on weekdays.
354	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Warmer on the bus
355	fairly dissatisfied	To get off my first bus 55 and not have to run to catch 63 by Cabbage pub, Gorsey Lane. These bus is seem to have same time, if I miss the 63 I than  have to 52 to Marian square and pray that the 63 is parked up at the Netherton NAC so then I can catch bus.
356	fairly satisfied	Display tells you to ring bell and remain seated however when you do this when disembarking the driver does not give you time to leave your seat and leave bus and sometimes sets off when a few steps away from stop and have to alight passed the raised stop.
357	fairly satisfied	The fares in North Yorkshire are higher than anywhere else I've lived.
358	very satisfied	Very satisfying.
359	very satisfied	nothing it was fine
360	fairly satisfied	To take me home after work I need to o get 2 buses.. A 26a from Harrow Lane and then a 28 from the conquest.. They don't always run in sequence which the means I have to make the journey to town and then the 21 back from town this can put at least another 1/2 an hour on my journey.
361	fairly satisfied	On other journeys - breaking can often be erratic with certain drivers making journey uncomfortable as easily slip forward on leather seats.
362	fairly satisfied	The 8 only stops at the Wagon and Horses Pub on Lawrence St. I needed the next stop but as the 8 doesn't stop there I had to walk longer than usual. But I would have had a 10 min wait in town for 10 or 66A
363	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Knowing I could get a return but the buses finish ridiculously early!
364	very satisfied	Nothing today, this driver is the best ever, he greets you, he's lovely but I've never had any that match him, I wish they were all like him, most are rude.
365	fairly satisfied	Less congestion from traffic particularly cars.  Issue of passengers paying by phone, this did impact whole of journey.
366	fairly satisfied	Slightly more room between seats in front or a person.
367	fairly satisfied	Not standing at a naked stop in a gale like wind. Being able to go earlier when the service is off for children. More choice of time than one (or at times two) hours.
368	very satisfied	Nothing, I'm very happy with our local bus services.
369	fairly satisfied	The price is more than parking costs. I took the bus because I was going to consume alcohol otherwise it would not be economically viable. Are the buses very expensive because not many people use them or don't many people use them because they are very expensive?
370	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Timing and USB ports and less jolting.
371	very dissatisfied	The driver was rude to passengers and staring at women as they boarded the bus in an inappropriate way.  He frequently behaves this way and makes female passengers feel uncomfortable.
372	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	If the only seat left wasn't going to be next to an aggressive, arrogant man who made me feel very uncomfortable and squashing me and knocking me throughout the journey.
373	fairly satisfied	Nothing right now.
374	fairly satisfied	Cleanliness of the floor at the bus stop and inside the bus.
375	fairly satisfied	Bus was a double decker. Need more buses on route. Journey was fine.
376	fairly satisfied	A bigger bus, or more frequent service as this bus is always busy and there is little space. The buses on this route are all old, can be very uncomfortable, very noisy. This driver was very good and the journey was smooth.
377	fairly satisfied	Heating. Either to cold and draughty or too hot and sticky. Too much condensation on windows.
378	very satisfied	The bus being on time.
379	very satisfied	No improvements necessary.
380	fairly satisfied	Stop people shaking and being anti-social at the bus stops
381	very dissatisfied	Attitude and behaviour of the driver.  They are very rude to customers.
382	fairly dissatisfied	Ensuring buses turn up on time, ensuring buses don't get cancelled without being made aware so you end up waiting longer than expected with more passengers joining the queue, so when the bus does turn up its already full and drives on by, so you end up having to wait another one
383	fairly satisfied	The electronic time display could be more accurate. The bus was reported to be running ten minutes late but turned up bang on time. I expected this, it  happens quite often.
384	fairly satisfied	Punctuality of bus.
385	fairly satisfied	Perhaps having seatbelts on the end seats would have been useful to prevent staggering and uncontrollable movement from unexpected jolting.  And perhaps a screen indicating the next stop that works so I would have no worry on missing my stop due to fogged up windows.
386	fairly satisfied	Access to a free public toilet for women, children and men at Kendall bus station. On the bus station level - where the bus waits 10 minutes at most to change drivers and for the advertised WIFI to actually work
387	fairly satisfied	Don't take cash, causes delay for people to get on bus. The bus should tell us which bus stop is next, because when is rainy the windows fog so you can't see when your bus stop will come up.
388	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Drivers by and large tend to be rude, unfriendly, unhelpful.
389	fairly satisfied	Bus shelter closed at one end eliminating wind tunnel effect. Rattling noise within bus removed.
390	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More leg room for taller people and being on time.
391	fairly satisfied	Room on the bus isn't the best early morning. Some bus drivers are rude.
392	fairly satisfied	Actual arrival time of the bus displayed on the electronic board at the bus stop rather than the expected arrival time (which is more useful than a paper timetable/poster).
393	very dissatisfied	Internet do not work most of times
394	very satisfied	Nothing , all is very good.
395	fairly satisfied	Improved heating
396	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Putting the bus info on top of a double bus when making a complaint , it had graffiti.  Cold
397	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Nothing/very bad traffic day
398	very satisfied	Everything was fine.
399	fairly satisfied	The length of time  it took for the driver change over at Aston University stop. This is a frequent issue on my journeys.
400	fairly dissatisfied	Driver not thinking he's a rally driver who slammed brakes on to stop rather than slowing gently.
401	fairly satisfied	Temperature on the bus, it was too warm.
402	fairly satisfied	On time.
403	fairly satisfied	To have more seats on bus as I can't stand with a bad leg for full journey
404	fairly satisfied	The bus service. It's the only bus that ever breaks down. Need to run on Sunday. Lots of people work. Can't get bus unless you go to Durham
405	fairly satisfied	Bus overcrowded.
406	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	For the X9 service route to include Sandringham or Balmoral Drive .  The nearest bus stop has no bus shelter , is dark and you have to negotiate horse poo to use it.
407	fairly satisfied	Arrive on time please
408	very dissatisfied	have drivers be more punctual with timeframes waiting on bus. Driver was clearly taking their time when approaching the stop
409	fairly satisfied	For every bus company to lower the bus for every person getting on/off buses.
410	very satisfied	Everything is ok.
411	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Buses arriving on time
412	fairly satisfied	Air conditioning.
413	very dissatisfied	After waiting for over 35 mins asked the driver why the 16:45 bus hadn't turned up(as it was bow17:20) and another bus was due at 17:15 he checked his timetable and said he was the 16:45 bus
414	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	This journey was ok, which is rather unusual! Normal journeys are over crowded and uncomfortable due to poor service on route. Also I find sometimes drivers are too much in a rush and can feel unsafe with how they're driving.
415	fairly satisfied	Nothing its good
416	fairly dissatisfied	Buses need to be on time. Bus stops need renewing, they are too far uphill on Canterbury Road.
417	fairly satisfied	The bus being driven more smoothly and more time given for me to sit down when I boarded the bus.
418	fairly dissatisfied	The punctuality of the bus
419	very dissatisfied	The 77 has frequently missed 2 stops prior to the terminal, often without warning. When asked about this the answer is 'due to traffic'. Last night there was no traffic yet the stops were still missed.
420	very dissatisfied	A better service. Its very bad service people have to get to work. I don't think the bus company cure if your late. Also there is never any buses home from Bluewater at night after 9pm.
421	very satisfied	Bus shelter
422	fairly satisfied	When its dark outside and there's condensation on the windows it's difficult to see your stop anyway. This is not helped by dirt on windows
423	fairly dissatisfied	the driver was very rude because there was a passenger that he knew on board and they were talking to each other and they were using bad language.
424	very satisfied	Very good.
425	fairly dissatisfied	Fewer stops, smoother journey
426	very dissatisfied	More leg room.  Better punctuality.  Reasonable fare.  Easy to use app. Reliable app.  Comfortable seats.  Clean surroundings.  Clean windows Regulated temperature.  Friendly driver.  Swift Journey.
427	very dissatisfied	This service is never on time.  It has made me late countless times.  I have waited over forty minutes for the bus.
428	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	This particular journey was fine, however,  I had originally set off for the E2, which was five minutes late and drove straight past me!
429	very satisfied	n/a , very happy
430	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Dedicated bus lane through city centre and parking bans on the side streets of the route
431	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Drivers attitude.
432	very satisfied	No improvements needed.
433	fairly satisfied	Bus not being so late
434	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	We had a noisy family that are very disruptive everyday and the drivers never do anything about them. The kids run around the bus too.
435	fairly satisfied	Park nearer kerb and lower platform when getting on and off bus
436	very satisfied	Spray the bus for nice smells.  The driver was okay, very friendly.
437	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Lateness of bus - was delayed by more than 10 minutes - seems common for the 63
438	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	We need a bus to go from Seven Dials to Churchill Square and back over the Dyke Road.   Homelees House is for the elderly and they need the service.
439	fairly satisfied	Wifi to work, cleaned before journey, USB ports
440	very satisfied	None, it is a good service.
441	fairly satisfied	Overcrowding on bus at 16:30-17:45.  Drivers just ram everybody that are at the stop , customers treated like cattle.  If the bus service runs every ten minutes surely driver can say bus full appropriately and tell passengers next bus coming in next few minutes.
442	very satisfied	I got home safely.  Can't get any better
443	fairly satisfied	The buses are always late (sometimes 15/20 minutes)
444	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The bus wasn't the normal purple line 87 bus, it was a yellow line single bus which are smaller
445	fairly satisfied	460/480 routes. Most days are late or suspended.
446	very satisfied	Nothing. Brilliant service, lovely drivers,, clean well maintained buses. Johnsons, Diamond buses not quite so good
447	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Temperature to cold buses always late / miss!
448	fairly satisfied	You are asking about one particular Journey. Generally the service is only average as buses are missed out regular and rarely on time.
449	very dissatisfied	Bus actually arriving and departing according to timetable   There was at least two buses missing according to friend who had arrived in time for 16:45 bus which did not turn up likewise the 17:00 bus failed for the third time this week to turn up    Buses departing to timetable would be great
450	fairly dissatisfied	The bus broke down. Had to change to a 42
451	very satisfied	Good journey
452	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Being on time, wishing bus driver would react with passengers.  Being friendly, heating on buses as it's very cold in the morning
453	fairly satisfied	Smoother driving seemed to brake late for everything Junctions, traffic light etc 5 mins satisfied though.
454	fairly satisfied	To make time shorter & when ever I need to get bus driver get changing & you have to Waite in queue to other driver get himself ready after while you outside & after that you go in it take ages really .
455	fairly satisfied	More frequent buses would possibly stop people using cars
456	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	By using buses that are in good working order and in good condition (i.e. not breaking down or setting in flames because of bad repair or maintenance).
457	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Cleanliness of bus.
458	fairly dissatisfied	Diamond Bus Company are the most unreliable company.  They are often late or don't turn up at all.  A lot of the drivers are very poor and don't control the bus well.
459	very dissatisfied	I wait for the Yo-Yo every Saturday night at 19.47 but sometimes the  bus driver does come up to train station, misses it out .  Very disappointed sometimes.
460	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Punctuality and keeping to the timetable.
461	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Driver's greeting. The bus route takes unnecessary detours which neither let off or on customers but serve to delay arrival time at the bus station. The roads they travel down are not fit for buses and often the bus nudges curbs and lurches across the road.
462	fairly satisfied	A newer bus.
463	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus arriving on time rather than three arriving all at once
464	fairly dissatisfied	Length of time - consistently double or triple the length the journey should be. Also, improve signs and warnings about constant changes to stops.
465	very satisfied	This must be the most efficient service in the North East.  It's always a pleasure to board this bus and the speedy journey is terrific .  If only my local buses were even half as comfortable or reliable.
466	fairly satisfied	Bus timetables.  The 10 is the main bus service from Newcastle to Hexham and has no timetables at all.  Not everyone is able to access online especially the elderly.  None at bus stop, on bus or bus station.
467	fairly satisfied	Nothing only negative was it was packed but at that time that's expected.
468	fairly satisfied	I would appreciate electronic boards at both the bus stop and on the bus itself.
469	fairly satisfied	I wish there was a shorter route from train station to Keele University
470	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Not this driver. But some are reckless do not lower the bus at the stop and stop away from the kerb, so that trollies need to be lifted up also to be taken off the bus/not ideal when shopping is heavy. Some are also too tired(?)to push the button to lower the bus.
471	fairly satisfied	The bus was missed out meaning a longer wait, more passengers=longer getting on and off , less space etc. 28th September , two buses missed out meant we waited one and a half hours.  Shocking.
472	very satisfied	Everything satisfactory.
473	fairly satisfied	Not enough buses on this major route at peak times. Seems fine if you live in fishponds..plenty of 48 &49. Always a problem on the kingswood route though.  Can't get a seat from old market past 5.00 pm. Buses are too hot and stuffy.
474	very satisfied	I was very pleased with the service as a whole
475	very dissatisfied	Not this driver but another ranted at me for hailing him on Lindale Road worsley said it was not hail and ride but it was horrbile man showed me up and upset me in front of all passengers.
476	fairly satisfied	There are only two regular ticket machines at Water Eaton Park and Ride.  There was a long queue and no-one using family ticket only machines.  Not helpful.
477	very satisfied	I found drivers on this route always cheerful friendly could find no fault.
478	fairly satisfied	Bus company have alternated bus times and routes not very convenient  they send a small bus when there are lots of passenger and double decker when not many.
479	fairly dissatisfied	For the buses to turn upon time and in the morning when everyone is going to school not to put the little buses on that we can't get on.
480	fairly satisfied	Real-time information.  Cheaper fares.  More frequent services at evenings /weekends.
481	fairly satisfied	Needs to come more often.
482	very dissatisfied	First buses are incompetent - everything about them is rubbish and prices just go up and up.
483	fairly satisfied	The cleanliness of the bus , rather have a double decker than single tier bus due to it being cramped.
484	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More space.
485	fairly satisfied	Could give you time to sit down especially when you have shopping.
486	fairly satisfied	Announcements of the next stop.
487	fairly satisfied	Journey could be vastly improved if more services were introduced to the Sunday service instead of just one bus every hour
488	fairly dissatisfied	Packed with school kids!
489	very satisfied	With this bus service I find the drivers most helpful compared to other companies.
490	fairly satisfied	Newer buses as we have a lot of ageing buses, the seats are not comfortable, some buses rattle and others break down .  We are the last area (Wansbeck) who get new buses.  We deserve better.
491	fairly satisfied	Initial bus stop ,no bus shelter or timetable. Once at the bus station, it was  a good experience, plenty of info, well organised good seating
492	fairly satisfied	More flexibility of choice no good for hospital appointments every 2 hours Dursley to Gloucester is not a good service
493	fairly satisfied	An up to date timetable at Morpeth bus station information screens to be in use.
494	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	About time they bought some new buses!
495	fairly satisfied	The online timetable I looked at before leaving and the times displayed at the bus stop did not match up. I was on my way to a meeting and so arrived slightly late because this information did not match up.
496	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	For the bus to come on time and not follow three others that left five minutes before this one.
497	fairly satisfied	Drivers need to speak better English and not smell of garlic, even sitting at the back of the bus you can smell garlic.
498	fairly satisfied	Main problem is the litter at the bus stop. Horrendous. This particular journey was very smooth.
499	fairly satisfied	Free WIFI, charging cables and leather seats.
500	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The cleanliness of the inside of the bus, very dirty. Very jerky ride as the driver drove very fast.
501	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The National Express app doesn't give the correct arrival times of the bus
502	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	This was a slower than average journey with particularly slow driving.
503	very satisfied	It wasn't a normal journey , the driver was nicer, he is usually one of the nicer ones - some are downright rude.
504	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Employ less grumpy drivers. Start pensioner pass earlier so don't have to pay to go to hospital appointment, hourly buses usually empty.
505	very satisfied	Today's journey went really well. I haven't had a bad experience on this bus journey to date.
506	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	It would be good if the buses were more frequent, it would also be good if season passes could be used on both Oxford bus company and Stagecoach buses.
507	fairly satisfied	This bus regularly runs late and there is no display board for arrival times.
508	fairly satisfied	Double deckers needed at peak times always Bournemouth very busy!!
509	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Time table, bus arrive in time, and double decker bus on busy times
510	very satisfied	Only that is was not on time
511	fairly satisfied	If it was on time,5 minutes late. Driver didn't apologise
512	fairly satisfied	Space between seating, quite tight, possibly audio announcements.
513	fairly satisfied	It would have helped enormously if the bus had arrived on time.
514	fairly satisfied	75% of drivers are very good. Others don't give you time to find a seat
515	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	I think its better if there's a display showing our next stop and I think its better to have a 'transport' card that is affordable and tap your card in the bus instead of waiting in the queue for receipts that may cause delays.
516	fairly satisfied	There are few bus stops on our journey.  The drivers are generally very accommodating but need top be told where to stop.  This means leaving your seat to press the button and indicate your stop.
517	very dissatisfied	Stop drivers jerking the breaks. Stop missing buses never know if its coming, stop going out of service
518	fairly satisfied	Not hitting all of the potholes
519	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Time keeping of the bus the cleanliness of the bus (lack of it was smelly and filthy).a well maintained bus.
520	fairly satisfied	The bus arriving on time.
521	fairly satisfied	The exact time bus meant to arrive stated on time table. The noise, rudeness of youngsters towards (illegible) young kids/elderly. The app ticket system causes problems with time on each stop. People push to front of the one to exit. Signs on bus, regular swearing, (illegible) noise.
522	fairly satisfied	Better leg room, my knees were pressed into the back of the other seat
523	fairly satisfied	You need more buses in the morning because Birmingham is getting busy these days.
524	very satisfied	Very satisfied, necessary service into Winchester, otherwise would have driven.
525	fairly satisfied	Bigger seats for larger people.
526	fairly satisfied	This is one of the shortest times I have had to wait for a bus. Going home (Lichfield - Stafford) buses are frequently twenty to forty minutes late and many haven't turned up at all.
527	very satisfied	Cheaper fares in general
528	fairly satisfied	More timetable information.
529	fairly dissatisfied	More buses going from Treliske to Newquay.
530	very dissatisfied	35 bus to and from work are never on time. The electronic timetable at the bus stop is a waste of time. No numbers to complain. If two buses turn up at the same time then you have to wait forty-five for the next bus. I can only catch the 35
531	very satisfied	Everything fine, excellent.
532	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Time keeping in Bristol at the moment very poor.
533	fairly satisfied	Cut out the swearing and talk less loudly. It's not necessary.
534	fairly satisfied	Seats are very dirty and wifi could be available
535	fairly satisfied	Nothing, do exactly how expected.
536	very dissatisfied	Seats require loads of packing. It was like sitting on a bone shaker. It indicated to me also the suspension on the bus  non existent.
537	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	A chance to get off the bus before other people get on. Sometimes the driver doesn't listen for the button and I have ended up walking past the stop I should have been at. Also sometimes on my journey I found drivers ignore me. In some cases I finish work, run to the stop, the bus is early so doesn't wait and pulls away
538	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Go back to the old route and timings - journey round the estate in Chellaston wastes time on a long journey. Also had to wait at several stops for timetabled departure time so too much time allowed. Journey 7S was ten to fifteen minutes longer than it was on.
539	fairly satisfied	Time for leather seats. Bus to pull up closer to kerb. I saw someone handicapped fall getting off the bus, driver never helped.
540	very satisfied	Nothing to improve
541	fairly satisfied	Bus not getting late.
542	fairly dissatisfied	The bus was extremely late with no explanation. I have caught this bus for over a year and it has never arrived on time.
543	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Nothing really
544	fairly dissatisfied	Being on time  Driver attitude
545	very satisfied	Arriva is a good bus service and the drivers are great.
546	fairly dissatisfied	Most drivers are polite but there are a few who are dead ignorant, should not be in the job if they aren't people person. Manners cost nothing.
547	very satisfied	The bus driver waiting for everyone to sit down.
548	fairly satisfied	Could it be possible that if a bus breaks down, could it be displayed on the timetable display board or if the other bus route knows the bus has broke down to let the green route know that's waiting  at the stops.
549	fairly satisfied	More space for people with walking aids and push chairs
550	fairly satisfied	The bus was packed as there were a great many school children. I felt that perhaps there should be an extra bus to accommodate them, (I usually avoid travelling at that time)
551	fairly dissatisfied	More frequent bus service. We have been reduced to one bus per hour. Not acceptable
552	fairly satisfied	I find it difficult getting on buses with a pram.  Prams are not so easy to fold now, more so when I am travelling alone. It would have been a great help if the driver would have asked the able people to move from the pram way.
553	fairly satisfied	Electronic timetable had vanished from bus top. No bell in arms length of me seat, had to get up in moving bus to push bell.
554	fairly satisfied	Sometimes the heater is on which makes journey uncomfortable.
555	fairly satisfied	The route can later on take a long time due to traffic, but this can't be helped. Also very busy around 5 - maybe often more frequent buses then.
556	fairly satisfied	Newer buses. Buses service the Chandag Estate would be very helpful.
557	fairly satisfied	The cleanliness on the buses is a cause for concern as I travel daily and sometimes the cloth seats are dirty and inside windows and floors don't look to be cleaned regularly.
558	fairly satisfied	Always late. rude drivers. no information
559	fairly satisfied	they never give you enough time to get seated
560	very satisfied	Nothing everyone was great
561	fairly satisfied	Drivers without issues!
562	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Electronic updates on the bus stop for exact/actual arrival departures etc.
563	fairly satisfied	During the journey a car crashed into the side of the bus - not the bus drivers fault. Because of this I got off that bus and walked the rest of the journey.
564	fairly satisfied	A smile from the driver.
565	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The timetables are utterly unreliable - I get this bus (or another on the route) everyday - they are never when they say they will be. Also, no student fares - which there should be.
566	fairly satisfied	To be nearer to the kerb and lower the ramp for elderly with walking aids, etc. And to stop other travellers being bothered by loud abusive yobs. Safe drivers are lovely and very polite but not all of them
567	very dissatisfied	The main problem is always that buses just don't turn up.  Despite fancy display boards!!!  I have waited sometimes forty minutes for a bus which should come every ten (Then had to get a taxi)
568	fairly dissatisfied	Make it bloody faster!
569	fairly satisfied	Drivers to be more friendly and chatty
570	very satisfied	Cannot think of anything to improve on my journey
571	fairly satisfied	Cheaper fares private bus for school children they always are very noisy and take all seats.
572	fairly satisfied	The bus arrived twenty five minutes late that could be improved upon.
573	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The attitude of most of the drivers - totally unprofessional. It's the concessionary card that causes it.
574	fairly dissatisfied	Wi-Fi that actually worked more comfortable seats.  Bus driver wait for you to sit down before driving off.  USB chargers.
575	fairly satisfied	Don't push people on a bus if there is no room (general point).
576	fairly satisfied	Lots of litter on the bus upstairs and unpleasant smell - journey would have been better without this.
577	very satisfied	Nothing really it's weekend so traffic was less and overall smoother journey
578	fairly satisfied	The bus was about 5 minutes late. This tends to happen around term time likely due to parents getting their kids on the bus. If this can be improved, that would be good.
579	very dissatisfied	A much much cleaner environment with friendly drivers and smoother bus journey for better comfort. Ticket prices are not worth the journey you are given.
580	fairly satisfied	More seat room I am tall and disabled and there is not enough leg room. Not enough space for me to stand up
581	fairly satisfied	Two bus routes (48and 158) always seem to travel as a convoy. Would be better if they travel with at least 10 minutes in between them.
582	fairly satisfied	I rarely experience rude bus drivers but unfortunately today was an exception, ran to catch the bus (I am 82 years of age) and hadn't got my bus pass out. He started the bus whilst I was still searching for it . He twice ignored me when I asked if the pass had registered and then I stumbled to a seat. From then on I had no complaints about the journey.
583	fairly satisfied	Bus is always too hot
584	fairly satisfied	When there are road works , please could you dispatch more buses.  As I now get quicker to Uni by foot then wait and use this bus.  Thank you.
585	fairly satisfied	A more modern bus not the old ones which seem to be on this route more frequently than in the past 6 months.
586	fairly satisfied	The kids being a little quieter but that can't really be controlled.
587	fairly satisfied	More modern bus that did not jolt.
588	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Routes and times.
589	fairly satisfied	Cover more routes.
590	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The Tracking system on the operators app needs to be looked into as it does not track the bus in Real Time.  As soon as the scheduled departure time has arrived it disappears as if the bus has turned up and 9/10 it has not arrived.
591	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Driver asking rowdies to turn it down and for the music to turn it off or turn headphones down. Also try to stop the bad language.
592	fairly satisfied	Bus stopping near the kerb. So difficult letting a trolley out of the bus when a long way from the kerb.
593	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	I travel daily, some days bus come and I can't get on as I am in a wheelchair and driver won't ask them to move
594	fairly satisfied	On other journeys bus drivers do not wait for one  to sit down.  Especially when going on to second deck.
595	very satisfied	People who put buggies in area allocated then take children out and sit elsewhere not leaving room for parents to board with buggies at other stops.
596	fairly satisfied	The seats could be a bit wider.  USB charger points.
597	fairly satisfied	I just find the buses very badly sprung and they are very shaky.
598	fairly satisfied	The temperature was too low
599	fairly dissatisfied	Bus arrive on time.  These buses are frequently late, sometimes by thirty or forty minutes.  Our village service is unreliable.
600	fairly dissatisfied	Bus needs to be on time and should be double deckers, it's peak time in the City Centre and they are always too full of passengers with the single buses.
601	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More room for passengers. More space for people to put prams, comfier seats
602	very dissatisfied	Buses need to turn up on time. not having passengers waiting sometimes half and hour to get on a bus
603	fairly satisfied	Not for this journey in particular, but First Buses on Sunday from my area are awful. Times have changed and people travel very early to connect to trains. Please look into this.
604	very satisfied	I couldn't think of anything really?
605	fairly satisfied	My stress getting to my place on time
606	fairly satisfied	Buses should be more cleaner inside and be more on time more as stated on timetable
607	very dissatisfied	Bus arriving at the correct time! Not arriving 20 minutes late, the 2 arrived at the same time . Being 20 minutes late meant bus was overcrowded, hot and no room to move. Stopped at every stop and took ages for anyone to get off.
608	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	If Birmingham council introduce clean air zone in 2020,they will have to improve this service buses for a start will not pass emissions regulation perhaps people planning services should think of integrated train and bus services but I think not.
609	very dissatisfied	Driver stops putting on his brake.
610	fairly dissatisfied	The bus turns up on time   The bus driver doesn't stop at every single stop even if they don't have to
611	fairly satisfied	Heating on very cold day.
612	very satisfied	Everything was good
613	very satisfied	No improvement required.
614	fairly dissatisfied	Shorter time for bus journeys takes too long, people get angry and agitated.
615	fairly satisfied	Ask drivers to be a bit more social to customers.
616	fairly satisfied	Timetable on Sunday evenings, more frequent buses
617	fairly satisfied	Sometimes you wait a long time for a bus, they could be fairly on time.
618	very dissatisfied	It could have gone further into town centre.  It only goes halfway into town.  Leaving everybody with a long walk to bank and shops.
619	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus information at bus stops, electronic displays needed.
620	fairly satisfied	Driver to allow passengers time to be seated. Driver to communicate with passengers - greeting. Driver to be able to provide timetables for the whole service.
621	fairly dissatisfied	The bus would have been on time instead of twenty minutes late.
622	fairly satisfied	Slowing down more, approaching bus stop when getting off.  When going too fast, you get thrown about when hands full of shopping and you can't hold on .  Also would like bus shelter back which was.
623	fairly satisfied	It took a long time for the bus to show up based on the time of the day said due in 16 min on arrival at bus stop took at least 20 min before arriving.
624	very satisfied	Larger seats.  Smoother driving, braking.
625	fairly satisfied	More Wi-Fi time allowed.
626	fairly dissatisfied	Frequency of buses supposed to be every ten to fifteen minutes.  Two cancelled, yet other routes , three buses came in the same period.
627	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	1. The hourly bus service running on time instead of regularly running well behind schedule - this missing connections and . 2. A double decker bus instead of a single decker particularly on market days. 3. A shorter journey from start to finish
628	fairly dissatisfied	Mainly the fact that buses don't stop at the stops where there are many school children waiting, the buses are empty but still don't stop. We pay for our bus pass too. Please sort this out, especially on the 11C bus service
629	fairly satisfied	People who suffer from vertigo due to movement speed should be allowed to sit down first. People who suffer due to height (seating) should be given seats in the front.
630	fairly satisfied	To have a double decker bus instead of a single one because only have 2 buses an hour makes the journey very busy and crowded as this is a popular route. (could do with 3 buses an hour on this route) (Romsey-Sutton &Sutton-Romsey)
631	fairly satisfied	Making it quicker and less stops.
632	fairly satisfied	Stop people of talking on phone loudly.  They not care about annoying others from getting on till get off  specialy foreigner .  Lady on board who gave this form saw a lady talk stupidly loud, laughing two languages.
633	fairly satisfied	Bus is quite old, could be updated
634	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Smoother ride. Less hardness of brakes. (Smile)?
635	very dissatisfied	The bus could arrive on time, instead of having 3 buses arrive at once, which is neither practical nor efficient. It means i am often left waiting up to an hour for a bus to arrive, when they are supposedly running every 11 minutes.  The bus changeovers could also  be sped up instead of them taking an unnecessary length of time. It only causes further delays. The amount of times buses have simply not arrived and i have been forced to wait for the next one is simply ridiculous. The fact that i have to pay ??400 for a bus pass is abominable considering the lack of consistency and reliability. I often find it quicker for me to walk then deal with the hassle of getting the bus. In conclusion there is a need for a major reworking of the system.
636	fairly satisfied	If all the drivers drove without breaking too hard, cornering at reasonable speed it would make for more comfortable drive.
637	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	In general First Bus Essex are appalling,  their buses are rarely on time, they're dirty inside and out, you can barely see out of windows and they are strewn with food and rubbish.  Most of the drivers aren't polite, some don't even say 'hello' or 'thank you'
638	fairly dissatisfied	The lateness of the bus which only runs hourly.
639	very satisfied	The number 5 Bus is an excellent service. I board at Terminus Tile Hill village considering the distance of the route compared to the 18 or 18A. The only problem is I can't use it on Sundays.
640	fairly satisfied	Please can we have a bus to Norton Worcester more often, perhaps every two hours.
641	fairly satisfied	Ban car parking at bus stop. I had to board in the middle of the road, not at the kerb. This affected the ease of actual boarding i.e. a higher step.
642	fairly satisfied	More room for prams.
643	fairly satisfied	As I travel with a guide dog a greater amount of priority space for people with a disability would be appreciated.
644	fairly satisfied	Larger seats, more leg room.
645	fairly satisfied	Luggage space. Papers on one side, used ticket dispenser on another side
646	fairly satisfied	Making sure that the bus will turn up on time.
647	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More stop buttons, driver being more careful seat not being kicked it being clean there being an electronic display of stops usb charging announcements fares and timetables ticket types advertised
648	very satisfied	Nothing excellent service - far better than Metrolink.
649	very satisfied	Great
650	very satisfied	The journey went smoothly, no complaints , I only use public transport.
651	fairly satisfied	Ability to lower the platform as the bus couldn't stop close enough to the pavement for me to get off.     More comfortable seats.
652	very dissatisfied	1. If I could access a time table at bus station. 2. Bus drivers offered manners and treat you as a person, elderly or not. 3. Allow me time to get out off bus! .
653	fairly satisfied	Cleanliness of the bus.
654	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	It would be good if the driver treated you like a customer, being polite and smiling. I can count on one hand your drivers who seem to enjoy their job.
655	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	K7 has been reduced from 4 to 3 journeys per hour. Bring back longer buses. The Jets are too small for this route, for young families i.e. prams and elderly - congestion at peak times and free travel time.
656	fairly satisfied	Because my only form of transport is the bus service, I do request that Sunday service be more regular. It is hourly at the moment.
657	very satisfied	Good journey.
658	very satisfied	Journey was satisfactory as usual.
659	fairly satisfied	Buses seem to be late a lot on a regular basis, very frustrating especially with two children one being disabled.
660	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus driver wasn't very inviting - no greeting.
661	very dissatisfied	Diamonds bus should start accepting other bus bus passes
662	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Designated space for wheelchairs on one side and designated space for prams on other side. Wheelchairs get hurt when you put with prams.
663	very satisfied	Leather seats, charging points  like other Stagecoach buses.
664	fairly satisfied	I was slightly surprised at how long the journey took. I used to get the train to work and I switched to the bus as the bus stop is closer but it takes much longer. It would be better if there was a more direct route from where I live.
665	fairly satisfied	More double deckers to provide space at peak times.
666	fairly dissatisfied	Punctuality, tidy bus, explanation and apology why they're running late without having to ask. 62 running all day and night because you have to walk from Argyle Road to Whale hill at night through a bad area for crime and criminals roaming around in gangs.
667	fairly satisfied	May I add the driver had an American style accent, he is obviously employed at Chester-Le-Street or Sunderland very, very pleasant. Been on his bus several times. Some of the drivers based at   Stanley can't manage a smile or hello. Some of them don't lift their heads.
668	very satisfied	No complaints
669	very satisfied	My husband and myself are happy with the service
670	fairly satisfied	Cleaner seats and floors on the bus.
671	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	I catch this bus every morning , every morning it is between 30-45 minutes late since the change of bus numbers .  This is not good enough when I pay ?62.50 a month.
672	very satisfied	All good on this occasion.
673	fairly satisfied	I would. A change in route and a different bus for older passengers as they are never ready with a pass and it causes buses to be late leaving or in bad weather getting soaked
674	fairly satisfied	Making long distance bus journeys i.e.. 50/20 double deckers so the buses aren't crowded.
675	fairly satisfied	I am disabled and have problems getting on and off bus but he did not lower the bus for me.
676	fairly satisfied	Not to keep changing bus times.  Keep times of buses the same throughout day as small changes can mean missing the bus.
677	fairly satisfied	More heating. Can be quite cold on longer journeys
678	very satisfied	Everything was satisfactory
679	fairly satisfied	I personally think young peoples tickets should be cheaper as I am only on apprentice wage as a 16 year old and my bus ticket is over half my wages gone
680	fairly satisfied	The ride is very bumpy - improved suspensions and road surfaces the bus rattles and is noisy - also temperature control is unreliable and depends on passengers opening or closing windows. There should be USB charging points!
681	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Not asked about route change on the 13 and 14 buses that run to North Swindon Centre.
682	very satisfied	Fine this time as little traffic early pm.
683	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	There is no or very minimal rack for luggage. Mine was small but I have to put it on the seat next to me. Good thing there were less passengers.
684	fairly dissatisfied	The time to my destination
685	very satisfied	No problem.
686	fairly satisfied	Bigger bus in the morning as plenty of people get on around 8 o'clock.
687	very satisfied	Can't think of anything
688	very satisfied	everything was fine, sometimes the bus is late but not today
689	fairly dissatisfied	The Diamond buses never arrive on time! Because of this I miss my train to work most days. It is horrible waiting around especially with no bus shelter.
690	fairly satisfied	Buses more often
691	very satisfied	Nothing.  Completely satisfied.
692	fairly satisfied	Coming when it says it will come
693	fairly satisfied	Regular frequent service. Sometimes have to wait twenty to thirty minutes for a bus.
694	fairly satisfied	More seating in mornings and between 3-5pm as only single deckers operate at present on 10 and 10A route. Always full of school kids.
695	fairly satisfied	Buses could be better times. They are every 20 minutes.
696	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Better cleaning of grab handles, on top of seats. They are sticky to the touch and must be alive with viruses and germs
697	very satisfied	Nothing, it was all good.
698	fairly satisfied	Fewer stops.
699	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The bus is often late with little indication of when it will show up. Fortunately on this journey the live tracking information on the First Bus App was available, but this is often not the case. Also, a larger bus would be beneficial considering the number of passengers is takes, on this journey specifically there were only a few seats left and not many were accessible for the elderly/disabled.
700	very dissatisfied	This is an hourly service and is regurarly late which is totally unacceptable. Yesterday it was 25 minutes late leaving Ashton Bus Station  so this is not an isolated incidence.
701	fairly satisfied	The driver can say hello or bye when you get in or off the bus.
702	fairly satisfied	It was very bumpy. But that is not the drivers fault .
703	very satisfied	Very happy.
704	fairly satisfied	If Wi-Fi worked
705	fairly dissatisfied	More regular buses at peak times to prevent buses being too full and uncomfortable.
706	very satisfied	Satisfied , no improvement needed.
707	fairly satisfied	The electronic display at bus stop seems not to be working properly - not showing No. 94 bus.  Also inconsiderate behaviour of other passengers playing loud music.  Very much in the minority.
708	very satisfied	Less traffic.
709	fairly satisfied	The bus turning up on time.
710	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Kept hitting kerb, this happens a lot on 73 and 74
711	fairly satisfied	The 468/442/464 are always late in the morning, you never get sorry off the driver, most of the time they are in a mood and look miserable.
712	fairly satisfied	Cannot understand why bus do not carry on to HR Kinnerton bus stop at Dodleston. It only takes 4 minutes extra (on two routes time)
713	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Always provide a double decker on the route especially with the withdrawal of the Avon N18 route. All the children go to St Andrews from West Kirby. It is horrendous prior to them getting off
714	fairly dissatisfied	The patience of the driver allowing passengers to be seated or in control of their standing.
715	fairly satisfied	Shorter stop signs at bus stops.
716	very satisfied	General comfort of seats.
717	fairly satisfied	Buses should be a bit more warm during winter season.
718	very satisfied	I could not have expected any improvement, everything was good and free travel is fantastic!
719	fairly satisfied	Waited too long.
720	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The bus shelter 59. Felton Lane stop. It is set back amongst trees. Bus drivers cannot see us in the shelter. We cannot see out. Foliage prevents this. Also 59 does not always come on time.
721	fairly satisfied	More shelter when waiting for the bus.
722	very dissatisfied	Less jerking when stopping.  More handrails.
723	fairly satisfied	Attitude of some drivers (not all ) to old people.
724	fairly satisfied	A little more heating.
725	very satisfied	It's very good.
726	fairly satisfied	Hallcross School children being made to use the school bus which was only 5 minutes earlier than this one but empty - some passengers had to stand due to the amount of pupils on the bus.
727	fairly satisfied	Bus a bit warmer perhaps.
728	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Better Wi-Fi
729	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The bus arriving on time
730	very dissatisfied	The 40 route has always been bad and only getting worse.  Daily the buses were cancelled .  When they do turn up , often the drivers are rude , the buses small and are damp and cold, they always have worst broken down buses of all the routes along Kirkstall/Burley Road.
731	fairly satisfied	The drivers knowledge of who to use the new ticket equipment and feeling confident in speaking to customers
732	fairly satisfied	More lightning at bus stop.
733	fairly satisfied	If bus had arrived on time.
734	fairly dissatisfied	In the evening had an argument with another car driver. Bus driver keeps honking at other road users.
735	very satisfied	I've always been satisfied with the customer service and journey time.
736	fairly satisfied	Bus was jolting a lot and the service is frequently late
737	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The bus coming on time as need to get to work for certain time.
738	very satisfied	Thank you for great service.
739	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Cleaner bus, passengers asked to get off if smelling of dope, (gives me a headache).
740	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Sometimes, buses can arrive early which can make you have to wait longer for buses and also late for other appointments.
741	fairly satisfied	The major problem is that other bus companies have cut and spread their services, so other than local area bus travel is impossible - plus we have no evening services so can't get too many social events.
742	very satisfied	It was fine. I very rarely use a bus
743	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	A bit warmer.
744	very dissatisfied	Smoothness , all buses are like riding a camel.
745	very satisfied	As long as I manage to get my next bus on time I am very happy.
746	fairly satisfied	More frequent buses. Fifty minute gap is too long.
747	very satisfied	No problems whatsoever.
748	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Having the bus stop moved back to where it was on Dorchester Street, where it is far more accessible to everyone
749	fairly satisfied	More information of fair prices and stops, maybe Wi-Fi information.
750	fairly satisfied	The bus needs to have litter removed from it throughout the day.
751	fairly satisfied	The app said that the bus wasn't due for 25 minutes so I decided to get the tram as I often do even though I pay ??54 for a monthly first bus ticket. The 33 is very unreliable as is the app so I do end up getting the tram more often than id like as it costs extra money. As I was about to cross the road to get the tram I saw the 33 on its way down the road so I had to run for the bus. I think the tram is a real competitor for buses so they need to advance more to compete with the frequency and reliability of the tram.
752	fairly satisfied	The bus has 2 sets of doors but the second set were not used which meant squeezing past other passengers to be able to leave the bus by the front doors. Very annoying when there is the option of an easier exit!
753	fairly satisfied	Going round roundabout and corners more steadily.
754	fairly dissatisfied	Punctuality and cleanliness inside the bus , a warm welcome on boarding the bus and acknowledging me when I said thank you to driver on getting off.
755	fairly satisfied	Coming onto the bus station in time to leave on time i.e. on the hour.
756	fairly satisfied	I had travelled to Looe to volunteer at 'Looe saves the day' festival.  Everyone was doing their bit to make the festival a success.  The campsite offered volunteers free camping, the organizers offered free food and hot drinks throughout the day.  Thus, we were a little disappointed that we had to pay for the bus to get to work each day (??10 for a 3 day pass).  It would have been nice if your bus company had done their bit too, as you clearly made plenty of money as the buses were always full when I used them.  Shame.
757	fairly satisfied	Depressing with the bus shelter
758	very satisfied	Good journey, no problems.
759	fairly dissatisfied	The time it takes getting to the A1M on an evening is too long as the traffic is always building from the roundabout. This slows things down and it is the same on an evening.   You should be able to top up Popcards at the Park and Ride sites as the website is hopeless at transferring funds.
760	fairly satisfied	The smoothness of the ride
761	very satisfied	Very nice quiet journey
762	fairly satisfied	Newer, better quality buses i.e. ones that don't catch fire or leak oil.
763	fairly dissatisfied	Bus was late by 15mins, then 2 buses arrived at the same time
764	fairly satisfied	A more modern bus. The 35 route often has old rickety terrible buses provided.
765	very dissatisfied	Fares information , welcoming drivers, announcements of next bus stop, regular buses following the given timetables.
766	fairly satisfied	Charging points,wi-fi.
767	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Try to be more reliable on times and the attitude of some of the drivers are very rude.
768	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Temperature of bus was not helped by the amount of people allowed on bus ,so many were crammed on the bus. There was no personal space. But my main issue is times and even buses not showing at all.
769	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Please change the orange sofa, it is dangerous and waste of seating space.
770	fairly satisfied	Maybe smells as I could smell sick.
771	very satisfied	The journey to Exmouth to Exeter was good  as I travelled early.
772	very satisfied	I have used No 3 bus to & from town since my husband died in 2003 and found it a good service and mostly runs on time (occcassional delay due to unforseen circumstances no fault of driver or service)
773	fairly satisfied	There was quite a lot of people on the bus, but it was a short journey from the run one bus station.
774	fairly satisfied	Better Wi-Fi(it doesn't always work), USB plugs, live tracker or net app.
775	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Driver being a bit more approachable
776	fairly satisfied	The journey was alright but there are not frequent. Early morning services and travelling to Crawley from Horsham, There should be a bus service from Horsham to East Surrey Hospital too.
777	fairly satisfied	More space for my walking frame - two big suitcases and another walker on board.
778	fairly satisfied	A smoother ride would be nice.
779	fairly satisfied	X1 and X2s are too infrequent
780	fairly satisfied	Friendly drivers.
781	fairly satisfied	Clearance of litter i.e. newspapers, drinks cans that often are found/left by previous passengers.
782	fairly satisfied	I take the bus M-F 5:20am ( bus x 315:30 leaving from centre) The bus is always freezing and some drivers never reply to me
783	fairly satisfied	Keep on time.
784	fairly satisfied	Heating is never on in the winter. Heating is always on in the summer. This need rectifying.
785	very satisfied	The driver was very courteous. I have a disability in both legs. Not every driver lowers the bus but these days there seem a little better trained.
786	fairly satisfied	Driver complying with speed limits.  Too fast.
787	fairly satisfied	Time given on the timetable need to be  respected be and some drivers are very slow and please  keep Bus 11 running.
788	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	I used to be able to get the 13 bus from the rail station rather than go into town on the 5 and then change.
789	fairly satisfied	Its outside the control of the company, but the state of the road itself is very poor. The bus was 15 minutes late leaving the bus station on a 30 minute journey, which isn't very good.
790	very satisfied	A seat in the bus  shelter at the Maryport / Curzon Road stop.
791	fairly satisfied	More leg room would be great. I am 6'0 tall (5'0 average) and I have to sit sideways. Otherwise my knees are pushing into the seat in front of me
792	fairly satisfied	The temperature inside the bus.
793	fairly satisfied	Better support for visually impaired passengers. I hate being asked to move out the seats for disabled people by non disabled mothers.
794	fairly dissatisfied	Giving the school kids their own bus so others can get where they want to be on time
795	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Buses are not on time, most of the time.  And a lot of time is wasted when people need to buy tickets on the bus.
796	fairly satisfied	Too many people using mobile phones and speaking loudly.
797	fairly satisfied	Not enough buses in the hour at the moment they are every 20 minutes, but a lot of the time they are often late, therefore sometimes have to stand, which when you are a certain age can be scary, especially if you have shopping bags.
798	fairly satisfied	Driver needed to learn how to use the brakes.
799	fairly satisfied	Congestion - however, not down to the bus or driver.
800	fairly satisfied	The seats could be a little wider
801	fairly satisfied	Why on the 8/9 routes people are left standing for up to half hour wait for buses to get into town, this is not a one off it happens on a regular basis
802	fairly satisfied	Generally the social media updates are poor. I have waited long periods for buses to arrive with no information available particularly on issue during bad weather /snow, it is not clear what service are running/disrupted at on early enough time.
803	very dissatisfied	Bus was thirty five minutes late.  As First Bus etc. have cancelled buses over the past few years I now have to get two buses from Filton (airbus) to Westbury -on - Trym vis Southmead.
804	fairly satisfied	Bus turning up on time!
805	fairly dissatisfied	There could be announcements and electronic displays to show the next stop. Also the bus should be double decker especially 26 is not enough space. Bus need to be on time (very late).
806	fairly satisfied	Politeness of driver. Even thought I said "Thank you" there was no reaction.
807	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The time it takes
808	very satisfied	For such a  short journey, nothing
809	fairly satisfied	The 'new' electric displays are (often) misleading (buses vanish, time goes back etc). Bus was crowded and one very smelly passenger.
810	fairly satisfied	Bus being on time.  Most drivers to stop putting foot on brakes.
811	fairly satisfied	Cleanliness of the floor and more legroom
812	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More facilities on bus for disabled. Also Lincoln bus station not big enough for passengers or buses
813	fairly satisfied	More frequent bus service. This won't happen because Flintshire County Council won't pay.
814	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Would like driver to greet passengers and apologise when they are late.
815	fairly satisfied	I would say a bigger bus because it was full.  However it was the biggest bus.
816	fairly satisfied	Provide information that the route in York had been changed due to road works.
817	fairly satisfied	More seating should be placed. Also, bus drivers could wait until you have sat down as I plunged when the bus moved.
818	fairly satisfied	There has been lots of times when the drivers are very rude, no please or thank you's, short tempered , bad moods?
819	fairly satisfied	Usually the bus is much more modern - today's was an older bus used on the Hadrian's Wall service, which is why it scored no points for relevant route info. The usual bus has it all, is very comfy. Does not rattle and has seat belts, all of which I would have preferred.
820	very dissatisfied	We are living in very dirty country so it is not bus company's fault , it is passengers are very stupid, leaving rubbish,  buses are not clean, smells.
821	fairly dissatisfied	I'm a daily traveller. Buses often late. Electronic displays at bus stop inaccurate.
822	fairly satisfied	Strict bus arrival times.
823	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bigger size buses as to small for service.
824	fairly satisfied	Drivers to be polite when paying for your ticket , e.g. saying thank you.
825	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	USB plugs, working electronics, obvious bins.
826	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Buses being on time
827	fairly satisfied	Time keeping.
828	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The journey on the 53/54 route could be improved by having roadside parking on Brinkburn Avenue/Coatsworth Road compulsorily stopped as this interferes with both normal traffic and buses.
829	fairly satisfied	Charging ports and wifi.
830	fairly dissatisfied	A bus arriving when it should have run.  An alternative to a nearby location was over full with standing load.
831	fairly satisfied	A double decker on market days, we mostly stand.
832	fairly satisfied	Make your buses more comfortable like the X2 bus. It's a pleasure to ride on the X2 bus.
833	fairly satisfied	As an elderly traveller the quality of seating on quite a number of buses is questionable. In some cases apart from a cover there is no padding at all!! Giving a lot of discomfort and painful for travellers
834	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Temperature of the bus.
835	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus reliability from the Science Park.
836	fairly satisfied	Punctuality and some drivers can be quite unfriendly and hasty. I once witnessed  an elderly coming towards the bus stop with is hand clearly out to signal the bus driver to stop. Instead of the bus driver stopping, he continued on as if he did not see the elderly man! This was very upsetting to see because the bus comes once an hour !
837	fairly dissatisfied	The bus could have been on time OR - it was at the start of 13 journey at the bus station an explanation or apology should have been made. The Brunts school pupils at the bus are always a nuisance but less so either we complained.
838	fairly satisfied	The bus being on time instead of late
839	fairly satisfied	Sometimes bus in on the time but  very often late.
840	very dissatisfied	Bus shelter in Swanton Morley
841	fairly satisfied	Display screen with stops.  City centre buses not have safety belts.
842	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The 300 needs double decker on the 8o'clock service as always busy.
843	very satisfied	More routes available.
844	very satisfied	The driver was probably The Stig! My wife was very at ease!
845	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The driver was quite nonchalant and didn't respond when I thanked him on getting my ticket.
846	fairly satisfied	Putting more buses on in the winter months for people who live and work here
847	fairly dissatisfied	The first 62 pulled into my stop (Cheswick Green direction stop). Stated it was for Cheswick Green on front of bus but went in opposite direction to Dorridge. Thus I had to get off and wait for later bus
848	fairly satisfied	Frequency of service improved. Not regular enough.
849	fairly satisfied	On this journey no,  but children getting on at Bosworth Academy behave very poorly generally.
850	fairly satisfied	No bus shelter at Welfare Park, Crowtree Lane, Bowburn, Durham so often get wet - none of either side of road - going to Durham so often get wet - none on either side of road - going to Durham to Hartlepool.
851	very satisfied	Nothing, everything was fine.
852	fairly satisfied	The attitude of the bus drivers. Some of the bus drivers have an attitude and sometimes rude and I feel upset after my journey but some of the drivers can be very nice, others need to change their attitude.
853	fairly satisfied	Newer, quieter buses.
854	very satisfied	For me this is a very good journey.
855	very satisfied	N/A  Ok
856	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus X221 from city centre to Woodcock Hill during peak time, runs at random times not effectively respecting the schedule.  The day before there were two buses that arrived together.
857	fairly satisfied	Greeting from the driver. Easier braking, less hard and sudden.
858	fairly satisfied	This journey was fine. I have no complaints. However on this service they are regularly late. Often running with 3 or 4 buses traveling right behind each other. Which means often you have to wait 30 minutes or longer for a bus that should be every 10 during the day. Also when I'm on a late finish from work and they are only twice an hour. Sometimes one of those doesn't show up which isn't great when it's dark at night travelling. I make regular complaints and the messages back are always the same. It's the same excuses rather then them holding their hands up and saying sorry which I'd appreciate. This service is just shocking at time keeping to say it's the main hospital route in Oldham.
859	very satisfied	Everything was fine
860	fairly satisfied	This bus turned up on time, but there are too many that don't turn up even when online check says they are coming. The online information is not very reliable or accurate. A lot of the buses on 20 route are very old and rattle
861	fairly satisfied	28 could run slightly more often, missed 7.30 bus and wasn't another till 8.10, so ended up late to work. Also free Wi-Fi.
862	fairly satisfied	Bus stop information display more welcoming terminus.
863	fairly satisfied	Bus being on time and passengers boarding the bus quicker.
864	fairly satisfied	Punctuality of driver seemed affected by new timetable (more than 1 driver turned up)
865	fairly satisfied	Due to road traffic accident on one of the major roads into the city, two scheduled buses did not arrive on this particular morning usually the buses are fairly on time.
866	fairly satisfied	Most Journeys I can  not sit down and/or are jolted around too much breaking. This journey was okay though!
867	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Driver should be more polite.
868	fairly satisfied	This journey was one of few that was decent. Most dawdle, late, hang about at stops, deliberately slow down at traffic lights (bus stops too near light). Buses are usually first vehicle (seven out of ten) at traffic lights.
869	fairly satisfied	More punctual
870	fairly satisfied	On this occasion all right however going to and from work is a nightmare. It has taken 50 minutes some days. I also encountered a very rude driver a few weeks ago.
871	fairly satisfied	The time spent at each stop waiting for passengers to provide money /app tickets/paper tickets.
872	fairly satisfied	Being disabled, using crutches due to a spinal injury, I wish the drivers would wait until I am seated.
873	fairly satisfied	Better and more comfortable seating
874	fairly satisfied	Put the heating on
875	fairly dissatisfied	Stopping some of the passengers from smoking and playing loud music and littering
876	fairly satisfied	Bus often spends too much time at stops.  Drivers changed too often in single journey.  Drivers at depots need to ensure buses leave on time instead of standing around chatting to each other.  Drivers need to not talk to other customers/colleagues when driving.  Please can we have buses that don't jolt when travelling.
877	fairly satisfied	The bus driver waiting until everyone has got to their seats before moving
878	fairly satisfied	announcements of the names of the bus stops
879	fairly satisfied	Newer buses.  (Too much old stock to use on this route)
880	fairly satisfied	This time the bus was on time but some other times buses are late on this route.
881	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus getting on time.
882	fairly satisfied	Driver could say "Hello"
883	fairly dissatisfied	Bus being on time and leaving other stops on time
884	very satisfied	It was lovely.
885	very satisfied	Good bus company. Brilliant bus drivers, always cheerful and pleasant
886	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The bus driver waits till you sit down before they drive off.
887	fairly satisfied	I use the 28 route to and from work most days. The journey is sometimes delayed making me late due to the amount of students travelling to Falmer. Can they be restricted at peak times?
888	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The driver pulling closer to the kerb and using the kneeling position o the bus
889	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Automatic lowering of the bus to kerb.  Bus pulling up where I am standing -not x feet short as I am very mobility and visually impaired.  Waiting for me to get seated  and a stop announcer.  Plus a friendly driver, sick of ignorance.
890	very satisfied	All ok.
891	fairly satisfied	Better seating , more comfort and space needed.
892	fairly satisfied	In general the driver must allow the passengers to get seated before the journey begins
893	fairly dissatisfied	Information on delay and route to be taken due to the accident which occurred at noon
894	fairly satisfied	Stop people parking caravans at bus stops car park - 50% of car park a no go area.
895	fairly satisfied	Need buses later on the evening after 7pm. Especially from the city to Bletchley.
896	fairly satisfied	More seats, as had to sit in priority for part of journey instead of standing
897	fairly satisfied	To put children mega rider in please, as I travel with 2 children every day
898	fairly dissatisfied	Get more drivers, but on more buses. It shouldn't take 2 hours to get to work. Make sure buses actually turn up when their meant to.
899	fairly satisfied	Swipe card does not work well as you need to load at certain bus stops, after paying online on the website.
900	fairly satisfied	The bus sometimes doesn't show up
901	fairly satisfied	Drivers breaking too harsh when approaching bus stops - could be smoother.
902	fairly satisfied	pot holes on the roads kills my neck-hard suspension (I wear a neck collar)
903	very dissatisfied	Lower buses with better suspension. The present ones are old, very noisy and vibrate for most of the journey. Not comfortable for a long journey.
904	fairly satisfied	Bus to be on time and driver to be polite.
905	fairly dissatisfied	The waiting time at certain bus stops needs to be reduced .  This isn't the first or only occasion where this has happened.
906	very satisfied	No comment, i am satisfied with the bus service
907	very satisfied	No improvement needed.
908	very dissatisfied	I live in Hampshire and planned my journey online.  I needed to spend the day at St Catherine's College for work.  It was very hard to find the right information about the route.  I wanted to know which sop would be closest to the College, which was the best route to take, which park and ride to use.  the information was almost impossible to get, After spending over an hour on line I ended up turning up on the day and asking other passengers.  Nowhere on line or at the park and ride where term detailed street maps relating to bus routes - a very basic error on the bus companies part.  I spoke to another lady who had exactly the same experience.  Really poor. Look at you information on line and see that anyone who does not Oxford cannot plan a visit via your web site.
909	fairly satisfied	Speed. Charging facilities
910	fairly satisfied	825 from Rugeley to Stafford far too busy weekdays at 07.30 due to college
911	fairly satisfied	Earlier bus
912	fairly satisfied	Bus was in poor state and smelt bad.
913	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	A double decker bus would be more appropriate for the amount of people boarding.
914	very satisfied	Satisfied
915	fairly satisfied	People should not wait in front of the bus, this makes it difficult for people to get on and off
916	very satisfied	Fantastic service from East Hull to Smith and Nephew
917	fairly satisfied	Maybe a little cheaper when paying by cash.
918	fairly satisfied	Arrive on time
919	fairly dissatisfied	A more frequent bus service.  Always late from destination to bus stop.
920	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Just that it goes all round Wythenshawe Estate.  It doesn't need to.
921	fairly satisfied	Bus to be on time, a light at the stop at Newhaven Avenue, so I don't have to stand in the middle of the road so the bus driver can see me.
922	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The drivers attitude and came a bit late.
923	fairly satisfied	A proper seat rather than the less comfortable ones right at the back of the bus..  Information as to whether I can pay by direct debit now.  When I enquired a few weeks ago the driver said it wasn't working yet.  Not seen any information on the bus promoting this yet.
924	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Probably a more updated bus. The buses are maintained but jolting and the smoothness of stopping appears to be a fault.
925	fairly dissatisfied	We have not got a regular every day service along Church Lane in Bocking.
926	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Shorter time taken for the journey.
927	fairly satisfied	Less jolting of brakes, but I understand this sometimes can't be helped.
928	fairly satisfied	WIFI on the bus because it is a very long journey. Also double decker because there wasn't much room. All nicer bus stop
929	fairly satisfied	Last week traffic from motorway accident meant journey time and walk was an hour/twenty minutes longer than usual. No communication from driver or the situation or apologies for lateness.
930	fairly dissatisfied	The comfort of the seats and the temperature could've been warmer also free Wi-Fi could be included .
931	fairly dissatisfied	The time it took
932	fairly dissatisfied	How long the journey takes.
933	fairly satisfied	Passengers with shopping trolleys taking up space so unable to access all seats
934	very dissatisfied	Buses should turn up when timetabled. I waited 30 minutes for a service that should turn up every 10 minutes.
935	fairly satisfied	Think most drivers look miserable in their jobs, need customer service training and smile.
936	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More frequent buses.  Smoother driving. Sometimes traffic queues are appalling causing massive delays.
937	fairly satisfied	Waiting around in certain bus stops to catch up on the time.
938	fairly satisfied	Bigger space to accommodate strollers/disabled people.
939	fairly satisfied	Driver waiting for elderly people to sit or find a seat. Be more vigilant of feet on seats.
940	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Electronic times at bus stops. Charging USB ports needed. Price list would be helpful.
941	fairly satisfied	Hope more buses can be arranged on the week-end.
942	very satisfied	At this time nothing
943	fairly satisfied	Punctuality. This service has a history of running late or on occasions being cancelled.
944	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Nu Venture buses are casts off form Arriva. They are all uncomfortable and do breakdown
945	fairly satisfied	More space for elderly people with shopping trollies. Better Sunday bus service from Birchfield Garden Widnes.
946	very satisfied	Nothing, it is a wonderful bus service.
947	fairly dissatisfied	Letting us know that the bus was going from bay 10 and not bay 2 would have been very helpful. No one available to let us know at Exeter. Shame on you.
948	fairly satisfied	Bus times arrival must be the same with the timetable shown at the bus stop
949	fairly dissatisfied	The main problem I find quite consistently with Blackpool transport is the inconsistency of arrivals and departures. They are meant to be keeping to a schedule but I regularly find I'm missing a bus because it's leaving the stop very early despite people running for it.
950	fairly satisfied	Should wait till older people sat down.
951	fairly satisfied	Buses leaving bus station 3 or 4 minutes early.
952	very satisfied	My journey on the number 2 bus was perfect. I live at Fulbourn and one service to home town is very erratic despite there are frequent  buses  to Cherry Hinton. I suspect that some just stop at Tesco and do not complete the journey. The half an hour service used to be 15 minutes . (some of the bus comes illegible)
953	fairly satisfied	Would certain passengers refrain from opening windows on top deck with cold outside as not fair to other passengers travelling on upstairs
954	fairly dissatisfied	Too many school children. They should run a school bus to The Gatwick School.
955	fairly satisfied	People talking quietly on phones. Being able to see out of the windows which were very dirty. Some drivers, not all, driving very fast
956	fairly satisfied	Frequency of buses to Franwellgate Moor.
957	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More room for people to sit , it's too busy now, more buses need to cater for Kilnwood Vale .  Could the 200 stop here also, maybe?
958	fairly satisfied	Bigger Bus because most of the time there are no seats available especially in the morning when people are going to work/school/college and at around 1700 and 1800
959	fairly satisfied	During school/college term times run double deck buses to help stop overcrowding.
960	very satisfied	Nothing on this occasion.
961	fairly satisfied	Sometimes buses are hold up in traffic.
962	fairly satisfied	less time and less money for the journey.
963	fairly satisfied	No litter, should be a bin.
964	very dissatisfied	Bus to arrive on time.
965	fairly dissatisfied	More awareness of price change i.e. expected to pay ?2.20 and told ?2.60.
966	very satisfied	I like the N5 as you can go to lots of places on it, so I am happy with this service
967	fairly dissatisfied	Buses to be on time when bus break down the next bus only gets to Lawrence Hill.  Then bus often goes straight pass you. When disabled it takes a toll on you.
968	very satisfied	This particular one was ok.
969	very satisfied	On this particular journey, everything fine
970	fairly satisfied	We could do with a better bus service as we only have a bus every two hours. And the first one to come at 9:30 instead (9:23).
971	fairly satisfied	Having information on the next stops. It's useful for customers if travelling to a new area or if the weather makes it difficult to see outside.
972	very satisfied	This was a great journey. Not always this good
973	fairly satisfied	Free Wi-Fi, comfortable leather seating. Improve cleanliness.
974	very satisfied	Nothing could have been any better. The journey was fantastic.
975	fairly satisfied	If the bus could be more punctual at times.
976	very satisfied	As I seldom use the bus this made me very aware of the other road users. I must commend the driver 10/10.
977	fairly satisfied	A newer bus and better seats on board, charging points for phones like Stagecoach.
978	fairly dissatisfied	Buses don't run on time. Drivers rush to try and make time up.
979	very satisfied	Cleaner bus.
980	very satisfied	Very satisfied.
981	very satisfied	I was happy with the bus journey.
982	fairly satisfied	More bus services on Sunday morning to get to work eg. Staff going on duty to hospitals as there are no early morning transport -staff. Have to walk on Sunday to get to work.
983	fairly satisfied	Again worst suspension I have known on all buses for years, you sit on one to Skipton by where wheels are , rocks your brain in your skull.  Shocking.  Very bad.
984	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus needs to be on time and timetables should take into account the traffic.
985	fairly satisfied	One number 5 on each hour insufficient . Also none at all on Sundays.
986	fairly satisfied	The road is very long and no one seems to get on or off at the last 3 or 4 stops. Has a long way round the houses but saves getting two buses.
987	very satisfied	The bus journey was pleasing. More care for the elderly and clean the windows.
988	fairly satisfied	Driver should not start bus until all passengers are seated - particularly if going upstairs although this didn't occur on this journey. There are times when the bus does not go to Withdean Stadium bus stop but stop in Eldred Avenue. This leaves passengers with an uphill climb and a long wait on Valley Drive. Not good enough.
989	fairly satisfied	On this occasion nothing could have improved the journey that was within the power of the driver.
990	fairly satisfied	Should have a bigger bus on this route as it always is a single decker.  On a Sunday and bank holidays is always a small single decker.
991	very satisfied	It was very satisfying
992	fairly satisfied	Later in the day when buses travel in groups of 2 or 3 and waiting times can be up to 25+ minutes, you would have got a very different picture. Try to avoid afternoon travel on the bus 3 of unreliability
993	fairly satisfied	If I was travelling on board the bus 263 I would prefer it if the driver did not wait longer than a full five minutes every few stops .   These long waiting times are at Sale, Stretford precinct and at Trafford Bar.
994	fairly satisfied	Better seats. Leather would be nice.
995	fairly satisfied	Nothing on this journey but poor service with large gaps of time between bus service often missing bus with gaps up to fifteen or twenty minutes.
996	fairly satisfied	Getting to your seat when boarding without the driver driving and the same when wanting to leave
997	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More buses on the number 1 route as they are often taken off
998	fairly satisfied	The seats are hard and not very wide.
999	very satisfied	Just the brakes make you jerk sometimes
1000	fairly satisfied	If the bus operated till later so I didn't have to rush.
1001	fairly satisfied	Lots of improvements
1002	fairly satisfied	Can something be done about ventilation ? Many people catch cold on the bus due to foul air.  Get on a bus in winter -the walls are soaked and ceiling drips (only 21% of air is oxygen -79% nitrogen)
1003	very satisfied	Nothing could have been improved
1004	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Driver needs to drive faster and not stop for three minutes every stop.
1005	fairly satisfied	Some driver don't wait until you have sat down before they pull away - I have a collapsed knee and this jolts it.
1006	fairly satisfied	Comfort of the seats and space to put shopping.
1007	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Faster journey.  More space, not so expensive for young ones age 16-18
1008	very satisfied	Nothing.
1009	fairly satisfied	More room on seats - bigger seats. More comfortable seats.
1010	fairly satisfied	I suggest that the bus arrives on time because that is the downside of this number buses.  Also during peak hours the bus is so congested and overcrowded and results in not having a seat for the whole journey.
1011	fairly satisfied	the smoothness of the journey
1012	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	There were too many passengers for this bus; many of whom were incapable of climbing the stairs, myself included. A single decker and a more frequent service would be better.
1013	fairly satisfied	The windows on the bus were so dirty you could not see out of them. Also people putting their dirty feet on the seats needs big signs put up telling people to keep their feet off the seat
1014	fairly satisfied	The seats aren't very comfy and they are very close
1015	fairly satisfied	Announcement e.g. "the next bus stop is…? and a map of the route of the bus including all bus stops.
1016	fairly satisfied	Always got ear pieces and talking to other drivers. Sometimes missing stops due to phone on and going over bumps on road. No respect
1017	fairly satisfied	Bins on all stops , plastic seating makes you slide off on brakes.
1018	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	This journey was from bus station. The bus stop going the other way into Town is not suitable and buses do not turn up at either end of journey. The 41A is not reliable.
1019	very satisfied	Better facility at bus stop .  Somewhere warm to wait during winter .  Keep Tesco bus connection to a Thursday, it's changed to Tuesday, not convenient for me.
1020	fairly satisfied	Timing , you wait for the bus they are often late , then two or three turn up at the same time.
1021	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	For the bus to be on time, for the driver to acknowledge the passengers. Bus fares need looking at, definitely overpriced.
1022	fairly satisfied	More leg room some seats very cramped and uncomfortable
1023	very satisfied	Very good.
1024	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	I am using walking stick. Many time it is very hard to claim up the bus. Some drivers will help me and some will ignore me. Just to do the step down.
1025	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Buses to run more than every 1 hour, and to be on time as they're always late!    To stick to speed limits and concentrate on roads properly and take into consideration there is passengers on the bus especially a 6 month old!    Also not go through red lights
1026	fairly satisfied	Comfier seats needed, charger points needed, longer lasting Wi-Fi.
1027	fairly satisfied	The bus to be a bit warmer.
1028	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Better signage and timetable in Colchester High Street. First bus had recently revised bus stop and failed to inform the public
1029	fairly satisfied	More buses from Burton Joyce so I don't have to be really early or late for work
1030	fairly satisfied	Maybe it could be phones upstairs only. And none to be used on single buses. We could all then have a peaceful ride.
1031	fairly satisfied	The bus stop at Saint Paul surgery rather dirty.
1032	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Punctuality.
1033	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	An improvement in passenger experience, practically relating to quality of seating, as well as the on-board WI-FI.
1034	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Train the drivers to break more smoothly.  They all brake without to people waiting in the aisle to get off.  All rides are very jerky.
1035	very satisfied	Nothing all good and organized.
1036	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The bus actually arriving on time.
1037	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Just a standard bus journey
1038	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The driver being more polite and not driving so fast, the bus was jolting.
1039	very satisfied	All OK
1040	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Windows were steamed up, poor air circulation.
1041	fairly satisfied	Single is too small for this time. Bus is rarely on time. Lines are massive (Buses out of service).
1042	fairly satisfied	Not  this journey but something needs to be done about this route. Either the bus doesn't turn up or it's late. I've seen me wait nearly 2 hours on a night in the bus station as after a certain time they only run every hour and when one doesn't turn up that's it. The bus station full of drunks half the time and it's an awful atmosphere and not nice.
1043	fairly satisfied	The bus driver didn't know the name of the bus stop I had to go to, but fortunately I could check the road online on Google Maps. Most of the times they don't know the names of the bus stops. Also, this particular journey was fairly ok, but normally with Stagecoach is not a great experience.
1044	fairly satisfied	The time I had to wait for the bus to arrive
1045	very satisfied	Satisfied with my journey.
1046	fairly dissatisfied	Cleanliness, noisy
1047	fairly satisfied	Buses on time, more buses , they are never on time .
1048	fairly satisfied	Temperature in the bus (was too hot) finding forward facing seat.
1049	fairly satisfied	The bus was very crowded but this was because there had been no 21 buses for half an hour (usually every fifteen minutes) and there were so many people waiting for a bus from this stop resulting in the bus being full to capacity, making it difficult to get off.
1050	very satisfied	Perfectly satisfied thanks.
1051	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Driver could have gone a little faster.
1052	very satisfied	Nothing! As for my wife and I are concerned. "Scarlet Band" reach perfection, we were just so grateful - I've reached the age of 90 and it felt fine to give (off scan).
1053	fairly satisfied	It could be at an earlier time.  Why don't the X1s from Liverpool start at 6am.
1054	fairly satisfied	I would prefer if there are audio announcements and electronic display to show the next stop.
1055	very dissatisfied	The 78 bus doesn't have anywhere near enough buses on the timetable that's why I have to leave at 630 to ensure I make it to work on time. On my home it's worse as you have to wait 35 minutes plus and buses frequently driving past due to being full
1056	fairly satisfied	The journey seems more unreliable  since Popley took in Oakridge .  It was better when the Popley bus went to the Aldermaston  Roundabout and then down Kingsclare Road to the railway station.
1057	fairly satisfied	Buses on this route could arrive on time. Sometimes they don't even turn up. Improvement to this would benefit all.
1058	fairly satisfied	The bus being on time. Nearly gave up waiting.
1059	very satisfied	We as bus passengers feel safe, Thanks.
1060	very satisfied	Happy with service
1061	fairly satisfied	More  frequent buses and drivers not to drive off early.
1062	fairly satisfied	Sometimes running a bit late.
1063	fairly satisfied	More bus services especially with a lot of students
1064	fairly satisfied	Elimination of bumps/potholes and better seating or bus suspension.
1065	fairly dissatisfied	Turn up on time, more frequent (every fifteen minutes).
1066	very satisfied	Cannot think of anything at the moment, I was very satisfied with my journey on this particular day.
1067	fairly satisfied	When the bus is either late or not going to arrive some sort of information to passengers would be good.  The drivers don't seem to know either.
1068	very satisfied	Nothing, the driver was very kind .  I'm disabled and he waited for me to catch up to the bus stop.
1069	fairly satisfied	If passengers don't conform to   general politeness bus driver should be able to give them a verbal warning regardless of age then put them off they don't conform.
1070	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus takes the longest route, doubling my commute time.
1071	very satisfied	I cannot think of anything.
1072	fairly dissatisfied	I am visually impaired so like to get near front to check where I am.  I was able to see the drivers reading their timetable
1073	fairly satisfied	Indication of bus arrival times at stop opposite JR theatre.  Urgent
1074	fairly satisfied	More frequent bus journey in rush hour.
1075	fairly satisfied	Seats available for passengers overcrowding buses.
1076	fairly satisfied	More travel information especially traffic
1077	very satisfied	Nothing really.    just  that  it a bit annoying when  you wait for the  bus but it does NOT  turn up on time.
1078	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The appearance of the bus inside and out.
1079	fairly satisfied	At 9/16 as stated timetable at 49 bus stop made a lot easier to understand. In simple terms? If possible? Also," the ""driver"" - to be more careful. When moving off and stopping to and from bust stops. For passengers safety? Specially for invalids?"
1080	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	If the braking of your bus could be average jolting, life would be better.
1081	very satisfied	Showing up on time on a wet and cold day.
1082	fairly satisfied	Not enough buses in the hour at the moment they are every 20 minutes, but a lot of the time they are often late, therefore sometimes have to stand, which when you are a certain age can be scary, especially if you have shopping bags.
1083	fairly satisfied	Passenger not talking on mobile continually for twenty minutes.
1084	fairly satisfied	The bus turning up on time
1085	very dissatisfied	This journey was okay but the 16 service has to honestly be the worst in the UK. I have waited countless times for over an hour. They never stick to the timetable and there are very few decent drivers.
1086	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	A small shelter would be nice for rainy days.
1087	fairly satisfied	To make buses more punctual especially in the morning.
1088	fairly satisfied	The heating was on full - far too warm - windows all open
1089	very satisfied	Thank you
1090	fairly satisfied	That the bus went a few stops further. It is not the bus I usually take because that has been taken off
1091	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The new buses are noisy and give a very uncomfortable ride.  They are very shaky and when brakes applied the bus jerks.
1092	fairly satisfied	Some bus drivers can be very rude and miss certain stops (not the present driver).
1093	fairly satisfied	Buses being on time. No breaking down.
1094	very satisfied	The buses used to run every half hour. That was perfect.
1095	fairly satisfied	Information available at bus stop about the time the next bus would arrive
1096	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Coming out of town centre a car pulled in front causing driver to slam on.  Not drivers fault however we was affected.
1097	very satisfied	N/A. Very satisfied.
1098	fairly satisfied	More space - somewhere clean to put my bags down. The passenger next to me choosing one of the other available seats (not invading my space ).
1099	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More regular buses
1100	fairly satisfied	Announcing the next stop before the actual stop. And a fares board
1101	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Unfortunately the bus was late which caused me to miss another service That I needed to continue my journey resulting in a long wait for 2nd bus
1102	fairly satisfied	Y2 and Y5 have replaced X49 an 47 which were at half hour intervals going to Yate Bus station, now Y2 and Y5 are at 4 minutes intervals then if missed one od these buses you then have to wait one hour. Completely unacceptable.
1103	fairly satisfied	Don't know on this bus as I only get it once a week , rest of the week I get my bus near my house which is 618 and that's another matter.
1104	very satisfied	Nothing, good service from Midland classic.
1105	fairly dissatisfied	I think that more buses should be put on during rush hour, because more often than not buses drive past passengers because they are too full or provide a double decker bus.
1106	very satisfied	Nothing, everything went smoothly
1107	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The condition of the bus (very old and noisy). Timetable not right at bus stop or online. Bus stop doesn't keep you dry.
1108	fairly dissatisfied	Communication; Why did three buses arrive at No28 bus atop at Basildon Bus Station only to either change to a No 22 or change to "not in service" and leave empty. In the time I waited there should have been three No 28 buses (2:20pm," 5:41 and 5:59pm) - Nobody was explaining why and what we could expect. ""Lack of communication leads to lack of trust which leaves room for doubt""."
1109	fairly dissatisfied	The time it takes you to come - as you hardly come on the time it's written on the bus stops and station's timetables.
1110	fairly dissatisfied	The bus was very worn out and old. It shook and rattled. Seats were used and overall not an appealing corporation. A regular bus service using main street, Hilltop. Trent buses ran this service in 1927. Why was it stopped in 2018???
1111	fairly dissatisfied	Some indication as to whether a bus has been cut out or delayed. A person whom I spoke to had waited an hour for a bus to turn up.
1112	fairly satisfied	Space for putting shopping trolley
1113	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus arriving on time not fifteen to twenty minutes late when people have to go to work.
1114	fairly satisfied	Less time to wait on a Saturday night.
1115	fairly satisfied	Newer buses.
1116	fairly satisfied	More room for shopping, prams etc.
1117	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus on time.  Drivers attitude with people.  No time to get seated with young child.
1118	fairly satisfied	Stop people taking one seat for themselves and one for their shopping. Stop people eating and drinking on buses and making a mess and having empty bottles rolling all around the bus. In Spain it is not allowed, time you did it in England.
1119	very satisfied	nothing
1120	fairly satisfied	Bus was very dirty outside. Almost impossible to see out of the windows to enjoy the beautiful scenery
1121	fairly dissatisfied	Bus was either late  or taken off service as bus I expected to get never turned up. Apart from that no complaints
1122	fairly satisfied	People standing in aisles or at front at bus when seats available.
1123	fairly satisfied	Distance we now have to walk from home to nearest bus stop to catch bus and distance from bus stop to home after journey . This is a result of buses being rerouted due to building which we were told temporary. Once building site was finished bus company decided not to come back leaving my self and others stranded.
1124	very dissatisfied	For the 501 to stop taking buses off or getting to the bus stop too early, hence waiting sometimes over half hour .
1125	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Consideration for other passengers
1126	fairly dissatisfied	The bus was very wet inside, because rain was coming through the roof.  The driver had to stop to wipe the steamed up windows and mirror.  A very old bus.
1127	very satisfied	Very satisfied with everything.
1128	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	I would've liked for the bus to jolt and shake a lot less, it gave me a headache by the time I got off.
1129	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	There needs to be wifi on every bus
1130	very satisfied	It was fine. I arrived at my destination in time.
1131	fairly dissatisfied	Sometimes driver is a bit grumpy. I suffer with balance problem so a seat is useful.
1132	very dissatisfied	On a service that is supposed to run every 7-8 mins you do not expect to wait 30 minutes for a bus as electronic display stated 2 minutes on arrival at bus stop.
1133	fairly satisfied	Sometimes drivers push the brakes heavily - they could do it more gently.
1134	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus on time. A bus shelter where we live. Not to take buses off en-route
1135	fairly satisfied	More time to sit down with the pram.
1136	fairly satisfied	On occasions the 48 bus hasn't turned up. Seems its always the 48 Route.
1137	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Having a bit of time to get settled with the buggy. The bus started moving before I could put the breaks on.
1138	fairly satisfied	Run on time.
1139	fairly dissatisfied	The driver clipped a car at Tadcaster, didn't stop, only got off to check the bus when he got to York
1140	very satisfied	Not at all it was a great bus journey.
1141	fairly dissatisfied	Given time to get  to seat before moving disabled
1142	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Not having to wait 1 hour 10 mins since last bus despite advertising as 1/2 hourly service.
1143	fairly satisfied	Bus being on time.
1144	fairly satisfied	The closest route to my house (34A) has been changed which means I now have to walk across Brickfields, which is very dark and muddy in the Winter.
1145	fairly satisfied	Windows went all steamed up so some sort of air conditioning required.
1146	fairly satisfied	Seating at bus stop-Peak time every ten minutes so you can get a seat.
1147	fairly satisfied	Buses being on time
1148	very satisfied	Nothing at all everything was very good
1149	fairly satisfied	Seatbelts in case you would like to be belted in-some drivers throw you around.
1150	very satisfied	Good journey.
1151	fairly satisfied	Accurate times on display board at bus stop.  More seating at hospital bus stops.
1152	fairly satisfied	I think it is very unfair that if you are paying for your fare by cash or card have to pay more than those using a smart phone. It feels like those who cannot afford a smart phone or computer are subsidising those who can. Even purchasing a multi-use ticket involves travelling to the bus station. I also find it galling although retired, I do not qualify for concession due to council policy.
1153	fairly satisfied	Have more friendly drivers and easy to approach.
1154	fairly dissatisfied	It was too crowded. The 24 is always too crowded. We need more 24s on the roads as demand is so high. It is too cramped, feels very unsafe.
1155	fairly satisfied	Buses running to timetable, no dogs on buses.
1156	fairly satisfied	The bus was very steamed up and a bit smelly.
1157	fairly satisfied	Bus in Winterbourne Down , there is no service . They have to walk a mile to the new bus stop on Hicks Farm Road or Hambrooke Common.
1158	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The driver could have gone faster
1159	fairly satisfied	On the route Citi 2 instead of every 10 mins to Addenbrooks or Cambridge Neath station we now have a Sainsburys Brook Road which makes mine now every 20 mins (not good)
1160	fairly satisfied	Drivers to be more customer friendly and helpful.
1161	fairly satisfied	I would say the service is the worst in Keighley,  very unreliable and  no service on a Sunday.
1162	fairly satisfied	That it is always like this.
1163	very satisfied	Being able to park at work.  The bus is fine, no improvements needed.
1164	fairly satisfied	More buses for rush hour.
1165	fairly satisfied	Please come on exact time of schedules.
1166	fairly satisfied	Put seating back the way it was there does not seem to be enough seating down stairs on the new buses when people get on buses they always stand at front by driver and want move to let people passed even when seats they stand there
1167	fairly satisfied	Heating!
1168	fairly satisfied	Run on time - was about 7 minutes late. Have been a long day as had been in Wolverhampton and couldn't get from Stockport to Cheadle Hulme by rail as planned strike.
1169	fairly dissatisfied	The cat5a and the cat5 is always late every time !   I wait between 15-25 minutes every time for this bus in lymm...Thursday the bus was meant to arrive at 1:19 but arrived at 1:39 and I was also late for college. This needs to be improved
1170	very satisfied	Cannot think of anything as this is an excellent service
1171	fairly satisfied	Not enough buses which they vary more often.
1172	fairly satisfied	I have to leave the house thirty minutes earlier due to the X1 getting stopped running through Castlefields.  Think this is a very poor service.
1173	fairly satisfied	For the return I had to wait forty minutes for the next bus due to poor frequency.
1174	fairly satisfied	More comfortable seating.
1175	fairly satisfied	the X17 is usually a Stagecoach Gould double decker. For an unknown reason tonight bus  was a single decker so it was very overcrowded, insufficient seats.
1176	fairly satisfied	Please could there be a shelter at the Highworth Road stop on the Oxford route. There is one on the opposite side of the road towards Swindon and many times there have been many near accidents when a last minute dash is required across a busy road in order to catch the bus
1177	fairly satisfied	The bus was old and in not such a  good condition.
1178	fairly dissatisfied	Driver didn't stop at the stop we needed. WE had pressed the bell for that stop but he kept going so we had to get off at the next one.
1179	fairly satisfied	Drunk people in the bus.
1180	fairly satisfied	At night on all buses you need a second person on bus
1181	fairly satisfied	Could we have better suspension on the bus as same time it's a bit too bumpy.
1182	very satisfied	Quite happy.
1183	fairly satisfied	Old bus not very comfortable or clean.
1184	fairly satisfied	Cleaner bus, comfort of the seats. I was very satisfied with the poppy on the electronic sign on the outside of the bus.
1185	fairly satisfied	The journey was all good, the waiting time was only long because I expected to get a different bus (NCT 35) which had been diverted (I was unaware)
1186	fairly satisfied	It was a very bumpy jerky ride!
1187	fairly satisfied	General smell as people as body odour from during the day can be a bit much on a long journey.
1188	fairly satisfied	I hope the Oyster card we can top up somewhere else and not have to purchase tickets from the driver,  because it takes so much  time [paying (especially in rush) during rush hour.
1189	very dissatisfied	Buses running to schedule as two to three times a week they don't turn up and thirty minutes between buses.
1190	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Driver's politeness (off of them), route map, electronic or audio announcement.
1191	fairly dissatisfied	Many drivers do not allow time to get seated before setting off.  They forget have passengers on the bus and not sacks of potatoes.
1192	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus is too small for all the college students.  Buses are often late or out of service, long queues.
1193	fairly satisfied	I would of liked the Driver to acknowledge that I got on and say good morning or hello
1194	fairly dissatisfied	Bigger buses are needed for wheelchair users!
1195	very satisfied	Timetable on the bus. A map showing the route of the bus
1196	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The driver could drive more smoothly
1197	fairly satisfied	If there had been a shelter with bench our side of the bus stop.
1198	fairly satisfied	Because the shelter in Sedlescombe Road North (opposite Seven Acres) has been removed. No I have to walk up two hills to get to Harrow lane.
1199	very satisfied	cannot think of any improvements
1200	fairly satisfied	Temperature inside bus too hot.
1201	very satisfied	Nothing journey was fine
1202	very dissatisfied	A helpful driver
1203	very dissatisfied	The driver caring enough to lower the step coz of my disability and Stagecoach never wait till you are seated.
1204	fairly dissatisfied	The bus to actually turn up on time, when trying to get off with my daughter the driver not to shut the doors and try to drive off.
1205	very satisfied	I was very satisfied with my journey and can think of no improvements that would be necessary.
1206	fairly satisfied	We have had bus route change, so when the 57F comes through Cantley its nearly full when it arrives at out stop and cant get a seat.
1207	very satisfied	Route 51 now very punctual in general, pleased getting on at Pickering Road, excellent now.  Having been on buses in other cities I do appreciate their use of audio announcement saying next stop and think this would be beneficial in Hull especially for tourists/new people.
1208	fairly satisfied	The bus being on time is very important but traffic issues could be avoided
1209	fairly satisfied	Information on ticket types and  fares at bus stop (Bath University Campus).
1210	fairly satisfied	At the time of day (5-6pm) buses are usually delayed and there is often up to 30 mins wait or longer. (interval of 23 & 24 should be 10 mins up to 6:10pm)
1211	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	As I had a child in buggy the driver did not lower level of the ramp and it was a disembark from middle bus, the was to big of a gap for me to safely get off there so I used front exit. This happens all the time.
1212	fairly dissatisfied	Drivers not breaking at the last minute causing people to stumble or bang themselves on grab bars , also drivers being more polite and friendly.
1213	fairly satisfied	Seats with more leg room.
1214	fairly satisfied	State of bus's. They are awful and keep breaking down.
1215	fairly satisfied	It was very expensive ?3.70 to get from the next village which is under 2 miles away.
1216	fairly satisfied	Drivers could have been more pleasant (very miserable)
1217	fairly satisfied	Driver should make sure passengers are seated before driving off.
1218	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus arriving on time and bus driver apologising for the delay.
1219	very satisfied	Nothing, it was a good journey.
1220	fairly satisfied	Too many pushchairs at one time, blocking the aisle, making it difficult to pass.
1221	fairly satisfied	Tell bus drivers to wait till people sat down I have seen six people over one month fall because they have not waited and speed off.
1222	very satisfied	On this particular journey, nothing.
1223	very dissatisfied	Paper timetables and on time.
1224	fairly satisfied	Arriving on time.  Having a ticket machine that worked.
1225	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Stop using such big routes.
1226	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	For the driver to brake better because you get jolted even when you are sat down.
1227	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The knowledge that my bus would turn up on time, which with the 23/23A is not the case. Half of all these services are late, waiting 30 minutes for a bus is fairly common.
1228	very satisfied	As a frequent user Connect service perfect.
1229	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Friendlier staff and staff that can understand you and the route.  It was freezing so heating would be nice.  4H Diamond constantly advertise free Wi-Fi , yet I probably get it about twice a month.
1230	fairly satisfied	66 bus is every hour. This is not enough. Mainly elderly people use this bus. No shelters along the route in cold wet weather not enough seats. And not reliable on turning up on time or at all very bad service and none on a Sunday. Disgusting service.
1231	fairly satisfied	A quicker journey as it's a time saver but takes as long as a normal bus.  Route needs improving.
1232	fairly satisfied	Leather seat, as material seats are messy.
1233	fairly satisfied	I was on an old juddery bus, lots of jolting -I suggest bus staff try sitting on there buses - perhaps these are used on this route because schoolchildren use this route and are sometimes messy.
1234	fairly satisfied	A bus stop outside my house in Compton Chaber Layne to save me driving into Wilton
1235	fairly dissatisfied	Frequency of buses, bus being late, rude and erratic driving of driven. Temperature, cleanliness.
1236	fairly satisfied	No suggestions comes to mind
1237	very satisfied	No, nothing could be improved or a leaflet all about the Mango cards
1238	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	In my area there is only one hourly bus on weekdays.  Fewer at weekends.  And it only goes to the bus station, a petition was signed to retain our previous bus service (41) but it was ignored.  There are many elderly and/or disabled people who need a more frequent near reaching bus.
1239	fairly satisfied	If I was on the bus for a longer journey ,I would expect the Wi-Fi to be working and working well
1240	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	That the bus came to my bus stop on time. It was ten minutes late.
1241	fairly satisfied	I am disabled and unsteady on my feet. There are occasional when the driver does not park properly to allow me to get on the bus safely.
1242	fairly satisfied	Stop people leaving rubbish, especially food stuffs and spilling drinks over the floor. Stop people putting feet on seats.
1243	fairly satisfied	More information on relevant stops for this service in the direction of travel ie. Stops closer to city centre.
1244	very satisfied	Nothing everything was fine
1245	very dissatisfied	Bus turning up At right time and a bit cleaner.
1246	fairly satisfied	I've noticed recently drivers seem very tired and have had a few near misses because of this.
1247	fairly satisfied	It didn't happen on this particular journey, but some drivers pull off too soon and don't wait for you to at least find your seat.
1248	fairly satisfied	My husband is wheelchair bound and finds it difficult on some buses due to prams and shoppers. Double decker buses are much easier for him but only run at weekends so he has to go Woodhouse Village to catch a 52 double decker. Why?
1249	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	I have had cause to complain about the behaviour of your drivers, of course he was on best behaviour.
1250	fairly satisfied	An electronic display on all buses where the next stops are.
1251	fairly satisfied	Cleanliness of the bus.
1252	fairly dissatisfied	Turning up on time , it's always late.  Extra buses for schoolchildren .  Change of drivers, being on time.
1253	very satisfied	Comfortable and safe.
1254	fairly satisfied	Sometimes buses are late or don't arrive at all after 4pm
1255	fairly satisfied	Bus was very late and there was no information on Thursday
1256	fairly satisfied	Boarding and ticket purchase time can sometimes take too long. Weekly/monthly passes on card (Oyster card style) can be encouraged more.
1257	fairly satisfied	The bus arriving on time.
1258	fairly dissatisfied	Drivers need to not keep braking as it was very jarring. Better driving.
1259	fairly satisfied	Bigger buses , gets crammed easily.
1260	fairly dissatisfied	More seats and driver needs more lessons in customer service
1261	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Would be nice to know they will turn up and not breakdown.
1262	fairly satisfied	To have the electronic display board working and being accurate
1263	very satisfied	Ok as it is.
1264	very satisfied	Nothing that is within the control of the bus company.
1265	very satisfied	Nothing to add.  No complaints about journey.
1266	fairly satisfied	Bus stopping closer to kerbs
1267	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Newer buses that are cleaner and cooler.
1268	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Other drivers are sometimes "jerky".
1269	fairly satisfied	The 39 bus is busy at the time I travelled so it should have been a double decker bus instead of a single.
1270	fairly satisfied	Driver could have been more pleasant.
1271	very satisfied	Having music that everyone likes and free Wi-Fi.
1272	very dissatisfied	A bus service that is suppose to run every 10 min during from 6.30 an onwards. There are always a day either going to wait when a bus doesn't turn up , most weeks two buses are missing. This mean to wait for the bus can be up to 30 minutes. This is not acceptable when the cost the monthly bus fare goes up every year.
1273	very satisfied	Everything ok.
1274	fairly satisfied	Not waiting too long for the bus.
1275	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Smoother driving
1276	fairly satisfied	This journey on time - often late or not turning up at all - not good for kids coming home from school (granddaughter)!
1277	very satisfied	Nothing to improve. Journey from Leeds to York good.
1278	fairly satisfied	The 757 is more expensive than other buses (?2.40 for a single) I can get singles using the first bus app for ?1.80.
1279	fairly satisfied	Picked a very good day for the survey. However other journeys are interrupted by bus waiting at bus stops too long even if no-one is getting on or off.  Public transport should keep moving, as a paying passenger we pay to keep moving to get us to our destination.
1280	fairly satisfied	I had to walk through the park to get the bus as the timetable for 433 has been ?鈧?tweaked?鈧?again so they run irrationally early morning!
1281	very satisfied	No comment
1282	fairly satisfied	Driver to have plenty of change. Had to give voucher out. No money.
1283	fairly satisfied	More direct route to and from work.  Less roadworks.  Buses not being cancelled.  Better layout of roads.
1284	fairly dissatisfied	Waited about 12 minutes for the bus but it was only the stop after Piccadilly so should be more regular than that
1285	fairly satisfied	A more frequent service so that X50 buses are not overcrowded -particularly on school/college days.
1286	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Not stopping for too long at stops.
1287	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Maybe because of the circumstances there was nothing could be done nevertheless it would be useful if the driver to comment on the position. A few words could make the journey more acceptable.
1288	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	30 minutes is far too long between buses we are a Town Centre service and need a bus every 15-20 minutes when they miss a bus we have 1 hour wait, in mornings the often is full and leaves passengers behind this is unacceptable.
1289	fairly satisfied	Stop eating on the bus.
1290	very satisfied	Voice announcements.
1291	fairly dissatisfied	The bus could turn up on time, what is the point having a time table when the bus is always late, is it just a suggestion table and what's the point in having the boards when the arrival times are always wrong too?
1292	fairly dissatisfied	Single-decker bus would have been better with two pushchairs and several screaming children, it felt very claustrophobic today where have our single-decker buses gone on 12/12f
1293	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus less crowded, too many people standing at front of bus
1294	fairly satisfied	Shorten the stops and to pass on roads that have much traffic lights. So much picking up of passengers, too much stops.
1295	fairly satisfied	The timing, there should have been a bus at 16:16 but nothing turned up until 16:30.
