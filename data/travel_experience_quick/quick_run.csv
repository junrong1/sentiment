"11388	fairly satisfied	The Route 51 is very unreliable bus route.  The times I have waited at the bus stop for the route 51 and the due time either keeps increasing or the due time comes and the bus has just disappeared of the indicator board.  We are encouraged to use public transport but if it is not reliable then what's the point.  Also the bus timetables are not harmonious with the train timetable which makes no sense.  They should arrive at least ten minutes before the train arrives at Chelmsford station so you have some chance of getting the train and vice versa getting off the train and getting the bus.  On numerous occasion I have got out of the station only for the bus to disappear of in the distance and the having the unknown wait whether the next bus will arrive or not.  Also I would like to add that the bus service should run at least to 23.30 making it easier to socialise in Chelmsford town centre in the evening knowing that you can get home cheaply and safely.",,,,,

"11366	very satisfied	Nothing really", feel we have a good service. Long may it continue!,,,,
"11364	fairly satisfied	The problem is this has been done on a good journey.

"11083	fairly satisfied	As I am blind", a lot of these questions are irrelevant but would say that 99% of the drivers do not put the trackers on to say what stop is coming up next so have to guess when to get off bus or ask strangers. Could be better.,,,,

Nowhere on line or at the park and ride where term detailed street maps relating to bus routes - a very basic error on the bus companies part.  I spoke to another lady who had exactly the same experience.  Really poor. Look at you information on line and see that anyone who does not Oxford cannot plan a visit via your web site.,,

"10142	fairly satisfied	Stop people taking one seat for themselves and one for their shopping. Stop people eating and drinking on buses and making a mess and having empty bottles rolling all around the bus. In Spain it is not allowed", time you did it in England.,,,,
"10133	fairly satisfied	Today was one of the rare good days travelling on the 350 as it was only ten minutes late.  Frequently people including the elderly and mums with young children end up waiting for up to an hour in which time three buses should have arrived and not one does.

"9708	very dissatisfied	Not having to get off the bus mid journey because the driver was so late due to hold up. I understand the reason for it but it's useless if you have an appointment to keep and you allowed enough time to get to it. This is the second time it has happened",,,,,
"9711	fairly satisfied	Like more women drivers - help the atmosphere",,,,,
"9714	fairly satisfied	Overcrowding on bus at 16:30-17:45.  Drivers just ram everybody that are at the stop ", customers treated like cattle.  If the bus service runs every ten minutes surely driver can say bus full appropriately and tell passengers next bus coming in next few minutes.,,,,

"9702	fairly dissatisfied	1. Electronic notification that the bus was coming. Far too often the 41D 41A does not arrive and we don't know whether to walk down to York Road or not even in the bus station no one can tell us if the bus is coming or not. 2.

"9470	very satisfied	good journey",,,,,
"9473	fairly dissatisfied	The bus could turn up on time", what is the point having a time table when the bus is always late, is it just a suggestion table and what's the point in having the boards when the arrival times are always wrong too?,,,

"9438	fairly satisfied	Bus was very full so double decker on this route in daytime would help.",,,,,
"9442	fairly satisfied	Picked a very good day for the survey. However other journeys are interrupted by bus waiting at bus stops too long even if no-one is getting on or off.  Public transport should keep moving", as a paying passenger we pay to keep moving to get us to our destination.,,,,

"9400	very satisfied	Nothing could be improved. The drivers are always friendly and helpful!",,,,,
"9394	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The knowledge that my bus would turn up on time", which with the 23/23A is not the case. Half of all these services are late, waiting 30 minutes for a bus is fairly common.,,,

"9388	fairly dissatisfied	The time it takes you to come - as you hardly come on the time it's written on the bus stops and station's timetables.",,,,,
"9389	fairly satisfied	I would appreciate electronic boards at both the bus stop and on the bus itself.",,,,,
"9386	very dissatisfied	Arriva is the worst bus company I've ever used.  Buses are never on time", finding info on site is so difficult , bus stations aren't labelled correctly and they wait ages at bus stops and I'm always late.  It is a shock to ever be home only or on time .,,,

"9322	fairly satisfied	The drivers could be more friendly when we say thank you to them.",,,,,
"9326	fairly satisfied	X1 and X2s are too infrequent",,,,,
"9329	fairly dissatisfied	The bus was very worn out and old. It shook and rattled. Seats were used and overall not an appealing corporation. A regular bus service using main street", Hilltop. Trent buses ran this service in 1927. Why was it stopped in 2018???,,,,
"9317	fairly satisfied	To take me home after work I need to o get 2 buses.. A 26a from Harrow Lane and then a 28 from the conquest.. They don't always run in sequence which the means I have to make the journey to town and then the 21 back from town this can put at least another 1/2 an hour on my journey.",,,,,

"9271	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The time I boarded the bus at Sainsbury's supermarket to getting to the park and ride site varies so much that one day I can transfer to the bus in front. Another day I can be sat on the bus until they decides it's time to go - consistency",,,,,
"9273	fairly satisfied	Having to pay less for the bus journeys! Far too expensive for short trips!!",,,,,
"9274	fairly satisfied	This journey was fine. I have no complaints. However on this service they are regularly late. Often running with 3 or 4 buses traveling right behind each other. Which means often you have to wait 30 minutes or longer for a bus that should be every 10 during the day. Also when I'm on a late finish from work and they are only twice an hour. Sometimes one of those doesn't show up which isn't great when it's dark at night travelling. I make regular complaints and the messages back are always the same. It's the same excuses rather then them holding their hands up and saying sorry which I'd appreciate. This service is just shocking at time keeping to say it's the main hospital route in Oldham.",,,,,

"9233	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	71 and 16 arrive about the same time at the bus stop.  It would be better to stagger these times giving a better service.  Folkestone Bus Station -71 should arrive and depart at the same stop as the No.16 on it's way to Canterbury.",,,,,

I get off one of the last stops but sometimes find myself standing as there are so many people on the bus already when I first get on. Journey times also need taking into consideration because it should only take 40 minutes from my usual stop home but took 50 as of traffic. This doesn't really bother me but would suggest trying to reduce the route so that people from my area", which is furthest away, get a more efficient service.,,,

"8927	very satisfied	It was ok.",,,,,
"8931	fairly satisfied	I was slightly surprised at how long the journey took. I used to get the train to work and I switched to the bus as the bus stop is closer but it takes much longer. It would be better if there was a more direct route from where I live.",,,,,
"8933	very dissatisfied	If the buses pass on the other side of the road", the first bus has been delayed. It should leave the terminus straight away so it is not late.,,,,

"8921	very satisfied	I was happy with the bus journey.",,,,,
"8922	fairly satisfied	Last week traffic from motorway accident meant journey time and walk was an hour/twenty minutes longer than usual. No communication from driver or the situation or apologies for lateness.",,,,,

"8880	fairly satisfied	If I was travelling on board the bus 263 I would prefer it if the driver did not wait longer than a full five minutes every few stops .   These long waiting times are at Sale", Stretford precinct and at Trafford Bar.,,,,
"8881	very dissatisfied	The bus could arrive on time", instead of having 3 buses arrive at once, which is neither practical nor efficient. It means i am often left waiting up to an hour for a bus to arrive, when they are supposedly running every 11 minutes.  The bus changeovers could also  be sped up instead of them taking an unnecessary length of time. It only causes further delays. The amount of times buses have simply not arrived and i have been forced to wait for the next one is simply ridiculous. The fact that i have to pay ??400 for a bus pass is abominable considering the lack of consistency and reliability. I often find it quicker for me to walk then deal with the hassle of getting the bus. In conclusion there is a need for a major reworking of the system.,,

"8551	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The driver being more polite and not driving so fast", the bus was jolting.,,,,
"8555	very dissatisfied	Seats require loads of packing. It was like sitting on a bone shaker. It indicated to me also the suspension on the bus  non existent.",,,,,
"8556	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Friendlier staff and staff that can understand you and the route.  It was freezing so heating would be nice.  4H Diamond constantly advertise free Wi-Fi ", yet I probably get it about twice a month.,,,,

"8535	fairly satisfied	Didn't take as long to get to my destination",,,,,
"8536	fairly satisfied	Driver should not start bus until all passengers are seated - particularly if going upstairs although this didn't occur on this journey. There are times when the bus does not go to Withdean Stadium bus stop but stop in Eldred Avenue. This leaves passengers with an uphill climb and a long wait on Valley Drive. Not good enough.",,,,,
"8537	fairly satisfied	Making it quicker and less stops.",,,,,
"8541	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More time to get older people seated",,,,,
"8542	very satisfied	Nothing", it was a good journey.,,,,

"8521	fairly satisfied	Elimination of bumps/potholes and better seating or bus suspension.",,,,,
"8497	fairly dissatisfied	The patience of the driver allowing passengers to be seated or in control of their standing.",,,,,
"8498	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	I catch this bus every morning ", every morning it is between 30-45 minutes late since the change of bus numbers .  This is not good enough when I pay ?62.50 a month.,,,,

"8501	fairly satisfied	Not enough buses on this major route at peak times. Seems fine if you live in fishponds..plenty of 48 &49. Always a problem on the kingswood route though.  Can't get a seat from old market past 5.00 pm. Buses are too hot and stuffy.",,,,,

"8507	fairly satisfied	More room on seats - bigger seats. More comfortable seats.",,,,,
"8508	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	More regular buses",,,,,
"8510	fairly satisfied	The journey was alright but there are not frequent. Early morning services and travelling to Crawley from Horsham", There should be a bus service from Horsham to East Surrey Hospital too.,,,,
"8475	fairly satisfied	Some more seats for people.",,,,,
"8477	fairly satisfied	The driver - aiming to come in close to the kerb later stopping - twice hit the kerb itself - no problem for the passengers but it would scrape the bus.",,,,,
"8483	fairly satisfied	Price of ticket for only moving two stops is stupidly high.",,,,,
"8485	fairly satisfied	The temperature of the bus", it was a very cold day and the bus wasn't much warmer.,,,,
"8486	fairly satisfied	This is one of the shortest times I have had to wait for a bus. Going home (Lichfield - Stafford) buses are frequently twenty to forty minutes late and many haven't turned up at all.",,,,,
"8496	very dissatisfied	Time-keeping", starting on time (late start due the driver having a smoke).,,,,
"8452	fairly satisfied	The road is very long and no one seems to get on or off at the last 3 or 4 stops. Has a long way round the houses but saves getting two buses.",,,,,
"8457	fairly satisfied	Bus timetable to be more accurate.",,,,,

"8449	fairly satisfied	Bus shelter closed at one end eliminating wind tunnel effect. Rattling noise within bus removed.",,,,,

"8403	very satisfied	We as bus passengers feel safe", Thanks.,,,,
"8404	very satisfied	This was a nice pleasant journey ", I would have liked a later service from Bewdley on the 294 to have avoided Kidderminster.,,,,
"8405	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Probably a more updated bus. The buses are maintained but jolting and the smoothness of stopping appears to be a fault.",,,,,
"8389	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The timing of the bus service around a lot of slack-could be much faster ", eight instead of fifteen minutes.,,,,
"8392	fairly satisfied	The bus itself was quite old and didn't have some of the comforts of the newer buses", leather seats for instance. Also, there wasn't enough leg room between the seats.,,,

"8380	fairly dissatisfied	Not having to get two buses to college and back home",,,,,
"8382	fairly satisfied	The price is more than parking costs. I took the bus because I was going to consume alcohol otherwise it would not be economically viable. Are the buses very expensive because not many people use them or don't many people use them because they are very expensive?",,,,,
"8361	very satisfied	Nothing all good and organized.",,,,,
"8363	fairly satisfied	Please could there be a shelter at the Highworth Road stop on the Oxford route. There is one on the opposite side of the road towards Swindon and many times there have been many near accidents when a last minute dash is required across a busy road in order to catch the bus",,,,,
"8364	fairly satisfied	Cleanliness of the bus.",,,,,
"8356	very satisfied	everything was fine", sometimes the bus is late but not today,,,,
"8357	fairly satisfied	A more frequent service so that X50 buses are not overcrowded -particularly on school/college days.",,,,,
"8358	fairly satisfied	Need the driver to keep an eye on when seats are full", not to pull at stops and have people standing up.  If we crash the people standing up will get harmed as well as those who are seated.  It will be the driver who'd get the blame.,,,,
"8351	fairly satisfied	Bus not getting late.",,,,,
"8354	fairly satisfied	Hope more buses can be arranged on the week-end.",,,,,
"8344	fairly satisfied	There are few bus stops on our journey.  The drivers are generally very accommodating but need top be told where to stop.  This means leaving your seat to press the button and indicate your stop.",,,,,
"8346	very satisfied	On this particular trip no problems whatsoever.",,,,,
"8348	fairly satisfied	More modern bus that did not jolt.",,,,,

"8308	very dissatisfied	Driver stops putting on his brake.",,,,,
"8302	very satisfied	Nothing.  All very good.  Efficient service.",,,,,
"8303	fairly satisfied	I think it is very unfair that if you are paying for your fare by cash or card have to pay more than those using a smart phone. It feels like those who cannot afford a smart phone or computer are subsidising those who can. Even purchasing a multi-use ticket involves travelling to the bus station. I also find it galling although retired", I do not qualify for concession due to council policy.,,,,
"8293	very satisfied	It was fine. I very rarely use a bus",,,,,
"8277	very satisfied	Nothing at this time (this journey).",,,,,
"8283	fairly satisfied	Newer", better quality buses i.e. ones that don't catch fire or leak oil.,,,,
"8284	fairly satisfied	Bus often spends too much time at stops.  Drivers changed too often in single journey.  Drivers at depots need to ensure buses leave on time instead of standing around chatting to each other.  Drivers need to not talk to other customers/colleagues when driving.  Please can we have buses that don't jolt when travelling.",,,,,
"8258	very satisfied	It would be very hard to improve.",,,,,
"8259	fairly satisfied	For buses to arrive on time.",,,,,
"8265	very dissatisfied	On a service that is supposed to run every 7-8 mins you do not expect to wait 30 minutes for a bus as electronic display stated 2 minutes on arrival at bus stop.",,,,,
"8267	very satisfied	Everything was good",,,,,
"8275	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Sometimes", buses can arrive early which can make you have to wait longer for buses and also late for other appointments.,,,,
"8241	fairly satisfied	There are only two regular ticket machines at Water Eaton Park and Ride.  There was a long queue and no-one using family ticket only machines.  Not helpful.",,,,,
"8247	fairly satisfied	Nothing on this journey but poor service with large gaps of time between bus service often missing bus with gaps up to fifteen or twenty minutes.",,,,,
"8251	fairly satisfied	Time keeping.",,,,,
"8237	fairly satisfied	Condensation on the windows / Anti Bac would be good in winter.",,,,,
"8238	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	The cleanliness of the inside of the bus and the windows cleaned. The drivers lowering the floor for you to get on and of f", allowing time for you to sit down and get off. Stopping people putting their feet on seat and legs on seats.,,,,
"8239	very satisfied	No", nothing could be improved or a leaflet all about the Mango cards,,,,
"8227	fairly satisfied	Buses could be better times. They are every 20 minutes.",,,,,
"8228	fairly satisfied	We could do with a better bus service as we only have a bus every two hours. And the first one to come at 9:30 instead (9:23).",,,,,
"8230	fairly satisfied	Digital timetable working as I didn't know a bus was cancelled .  Waited an extra ten minutes for the bus to be late.",,,,,
"8231	fairly satisfied	Not for this journey in particular", but First Buses on Sunday from my area are awful. Times have changed and people travel very early to connect to trains. Please look into this.,,,,

"8214	fairly satisfied	Bus stop information display more welcoming terminus.",,,,,

"8210	very satisfied	This journey was good but have had bad passengers on bus in past.",,,,,
"8213	fairly dissatisfied	A shorter journey.  The 104 goes to and from Thorpe Astley and goes through Braunston e", every little road through there, it is ridiculous and takes fifty minutes too.  It's great having buses every thirty minutes but the journey time has more than doubled.  Thorpe Astley is growing , it's about time it had it's own route..,,
"8197	fairly satisfied	The cleanliness on the buses is a cause for concern as I travel daily and sometimes the cloth seats are dirty and inside windows and floors don't look to be cleaned regularly.",,,,,
"8198	fairly satisfied	Some bus drivers can be very rude and miss certain stops (not the present driver).",,,,,
"8201	very satisfied	Nothing really.    just  that  it a bit annoying when  you wait for the  bus but it does NOT  turn up on time.",,,,,

"8183	fairly satisfied	For every bus company to lower the bus for every person getting on/off buses.",,,,,
"8184	fairly dissatisfied	A bus arriving when it should have run.  An alternative to a nearby location was over full with standing load.",,,,,
"8165	very dissatisfied	A helpful driver",,,,,
"8167	fairly satisfied	The bus to be a bit warmer.",,,,,
"8170	fairly satisfied	A more modern bus. The 35 route often has old rickety terrible buses provided.",,,,,
"8171	fairly satisfied	Driver would lower bus. As he explained he pushed button but did not work. I have chronic osteoarthritis. My spine", feet, knees, and hips so as I was standing too long I just wanted a seat.,,
"8155	fairly satisfied	We have had bus route change", so when the 57F comes through Cantley its nearly full when it arrives at out stop and cant get a seat.,,,,
"8160	fairly dissatisfied	Windows could be cleaner", beautiful views on some routes in Cornwall but windows always dirty.,,,,
"8152	fairly satisfied	More leg room some seats very cramped and uncomfortable",,,,,
"8153	very satisfied	Nothing everything was fine",,,,,
"8145	fairly satisfied	Punctuality and some drivers can be quite unfriendly and hasty. I once witnessed  an elderly coming towards the bus stop with is hand clearly out to signal the bus driver to stop. Instead of the bus driver stopping", he continued on as if he did not see the elderly man! This was very upsetting to see because the bus comes once an hour !,,,,
"8147	fairly dissatisfied	The first bus 31X for example are very old! Heating should be given priority specially for the elderly. Bus fares are too expensive! Renewable energy should be embraced for cheaper fare", buses should be changed. Solar buses as alternative.,,,,
"8149	fairly satisfied	I live in Wecock and there could be at least two buses running on a Sunday and during the week at least one bus a day that goes straight through to Havant", also buses need better air conditioning during summer,,,,

"8131	fairly satisfied	Walking stick set for elderly or people with bad leg or walking and space for push chair passengers and helpful drivers",,,,,
"8132	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	I think its better if there's a display showing our next stop and I think its better to have a 'transport' card that is affordable and tap your card in the bus instead of waiting in the queue for receipts that may cause delays.",,,,,
"8133	very satisfied	None. Very good bus service. Better than 47",,,,,
"8115	very satisfied	Absolutely nothing.",,,,,

"8106	fairly satisfied	Journey could be vastly improved if more services were introduced to the Sunday service instead of just one bus every hour",,,,,
"8107	fairly satisfied	I had travelled to Looe to volunteer at 'Looe saves the day' festival.  Everyone was doing their bit to make the festival a success.  The campsite offered volunteers free camping", the organizers offered free food and hot drinks throughout the day.  Thus, we were a little disappointed that we had to pay for the bus to get to work each day (??10 for a 3 day pass).  It would have been nice if your bus company had done their bit too, as you clearly made plenty of money as the buses were always full when I used them.  Shame.,,
"8112	very satisfied	This must be the most efficient service in the North East.  It's always a pleasure to board this bus and the speedy journey is terrific .  If only my local buses were even half as comfortable or reliable.",,,,,

"8082	fairly satisfied	Sometimes you wait a long time for a bus", they could be fairly on time.,,,,
"8072	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Bus is too small for all the college students.  Buses are often late or out of service", long queues.,,,,

"8078	fairly satisfied	Buses seem to be late a lot on a regular basis", very frustrating especially with two children one being disabled.,,,,

"8047	fairly satisfied	197 takes far too long. That compared to other buses.",,,,,

"8022	fairly satisfied	More punctual",,,,,
"8026	very satisfied	Nothing could have been improved with this particular journey however the 415 service is very unreliable.  Buses are not often enough and I know plenty of people myself included who really rely non this service .  Buses are regularly missing and generally being the older buses because of the speed bumps in Alkrington they also regularly break down.  Therefore as things stand it is already ridiculous to have to wait for an hour if one bus is missing or broken down .  I am absolutely appalled to hear this service may be made hourly now.  So now if one bus is missing or broken down that would mean a two hour wait.",,,,,
"8027	fairly satisfied	I find it difficult getting on buses with a pram.  Prams are not so easy to fold now", more so when I am travelling alone. It would have been a great help if the driver would have asked the able people to move from the pram way.,,,,
"8028	fairly dissatisfied	Mainly the fact that buses don't stop at the stops where there are many school children waiting", the buses are empty but still don't stop. We pay for our bus pass too. Please sort this out, especially on the 11C bus service,,,
"8015	fairly satisfied	Evening timings also buses increases is required. It means travelling of buses in the evenings is frequently now it must be increased as possible.",,,,,
"8018	fairly satisfied	Provide information that the route in York had been changed due to road works.",,,,,
"8020	fairly satisfied	It didn't happen on this particular journey", but some drivers pull off too soon and don't wait for you to at least find your seat.,,,,
"8003	fairly satisfied	Noise.  Very noisy (not passengers)",,,,,

"7980	fairly satisfied	The bus stop at Saint Paul surgery rather dirty.",,,,,
"7967	fairly satisfied	Better seats. Leather would be nice.",,,,,
"7968	fairly satisfied	Y2 and Y5 have replaced X49 an 47 which were at half hour intervals going to Yate Bus station", now Y2 and Y5 are at 4 minutes intervals then if missed one od these buses you then have to wait one hour. Completely unacceptable.,,,,
"7971	very satisfied	It was all very satisfactory",,,,,

"7964	fairly satisfied	Double deckers needed at peak times always Bournemouth very busy!!",,,,,
"7965	fairly dissatisfied	The bus was very wet inside", because rain was coming through the roof.  The driver had to stop to wipe the steamed up windows and mirror.  A very old bus.,,,,
"7944	very satisfied	Nothing", good service from Midland classic.,,,,
"7946	neither satisfied nor dissatisfied	Make the 18 every 30 minutes.",,,,,
"7950	fairly satisfied	Its outside the control of the company", but the state of the road itself is very poor. The bus was 15 minutes late leaving the bus station on a 30 minute journey, which isn't very good.,,,
"7951	fairly satisfied	The wifi could be improved", bus could stop at less stops on the route,,,,
"7939	fairly satisfied	The bus was packed as there were a great many school children. I felt that perhaps there should be an extra bus to accommodate them", (I usually avoid travelling at that time),,,,
